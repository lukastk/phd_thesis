	abstract = {In this review, we discuss recent advances in the self-assembly of selfpropelled colloidal particles and highlight some of the most exciting results in this field, with a specific focus on dry active matter. We explore this phenomenology through the lens of the complexity of the colloidal building blocks. We begin by considering the behavior of isotropic spherical particles. We then discuss the case of amphiphilic and dipolar Janus particles. Finally, we show how the geometry of the colloids and/or the directionality of their interactions can be used to control the physical properties of the assembled active aggregates, and we suggest possible strategies for how to exploit activity as a tunable driving force for self-assembly. The unique properties of active colloids lend promise to the design of the next generation of functional, environment-sensing microstructures able to perform specific tasks in an autonomous and targeted manner.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in classical density functional theory are combined with stochastic process theory and rare event techniques to formulate a theoretical description of nucleation, including crystallization, that can predict nonclassical nucleation pathways based on no input other than the interaction potential of the particles making up the system. The theory is formulated directly in terms of the density field, thus forgoing the need to define collective variables. It is illustrated by application to diffusion-limited nucleation of macromolecules in solution for both liquid-liquid separation and crystallization. Both involve nonclassical pathways with crystallization, in particular, proceeding by a two-step mechanism consisting of the formation of a dense-solution droplet followed by ordering originating at the core of the droplet. Furthermore, during the ordering, the free-energy surface shows shallow minima associated with the freezing of liquid into solid shells, which may shed light on the widely observed metastability of nanoscale clusters.},

	abstract = {A molecular model of poorly understood hydrophobic effects is heuristically developed using the methods of information theory. Because primitive hydrophobic effects can be tied to the probability of observing a molecular-sized cavity in the solvent, the probability distribution of the number of solvent centers in a cavity volume is modeled on the basis of the two moments available from the density and radial distribution of oxygen atoms in liquid water. The modeled distribution then yields the probability that no solvent centers are found in the cavity volume. This model is shown to account quantitatively for the central hydrophobic phenomena of cavity formation and association of inert gas solutes. The connection of information theory to statistical thermodynamics provides a basis for clarification of hydrophobic effects. The simplicity and flexibility of the approach suggest that it should permit applications to conformational equilibria of nonpolar solutes and hydrophobic residues in biopolymers.},

	abstract = {We present a model of a collection of active and adhesive Brownian particles that are capable of aggregation. Besides the mechanical interaction between particles, a simple active dynamics term (motility) is included to provide an active movement. At a given instant, each particle is either in an active (swim) or unanimated (stop) state, which is controlled by a random process. The model includes important features that are inspired by the phenomenon of biological cell- cell association. One feature is the mean motility that is related to the percentage of the particle being active and the maximum swimming speed. Another feature is the stochastic nature of switching between the swim and stop state. We explored how these key features affect the nucleation dynamics and the stability of the aggregates using simulations. Interestingly, particles can change their collective behavior by solely altering the frequency of switching between the swim and stop state while keeping the mean motility unchanged. These results provide insight into how motor-driven forces can be utilized by active biological systems to modulate the single-to-cluster transition efficiently. A dimensionless parameter is also proposed to measure the overall strength of the nonequilibrium effect on active particles.},

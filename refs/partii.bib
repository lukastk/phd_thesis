Within the framework of the Cosserat media each point of the media can be represented as an infinitesimal rigid body. This means that in this media there exist stresses and couple stresses as responses for translational and rotational degrees of freedom. These characteristic features of the Cosserat continuum model give a possibility to describe more complex media, for example, micro-inhomogeneous materials, polycrystalline and cellular solids, foams, lattices, masonries, particle assemblies, magnetic rheological fluids, liquid crystals, etc. The aim of this chapter consists of a brief presentation of basics of Cosserat continuum mechanics including kinematics, dynamics and constitutive modeling.},

A representative of such models is the Cosserat continuum. The basic idea of this model is the independence of translations and rotations (and by analogy, the independence of forces and moments). With the help of this model some additional effects in solid and fluid mechanics can be explained in a more satisfying manner. They are established in experiments, but not presented by the classical equations. In this paper the Cosserat-type theories of plates and shells are debated as a special application of the Cosserat theory.},

The method is oriented towards applications involving microscopic devices or organisms in the soft-bio-matter realm. By considering that the strain energy of the solid may explicitly depend on time, we incorporate a mechanism for active response. The solids are modeled as Cosserat rods, a detailed formulation being provided for the planar non-shearable case. The discretization adopts one-dimensional Hermite elements for the rod and two-dimensional low-order Lagrange elements for the fluid's velocity and pressure. The fluid mesh is boundary-fitted, with remeshing at each time step. Several time marching schemes are studied, of which a semi-implicit scheme emerges as most effective. The method is demonstrated in very challenging examples: the roll-up of a rod to circular shape and later sudden release, the interaction of a soft rod with a fluid jet and the active self-locomotion of a sperm-like rod. The article includes a detailed description of a code that implements the method in the Firedrake library.},

  abstract = {Significance             Biohybrid machines have been developed using muscles to actuate soft robotic structures. We envision that the integration of neurons into the embodiment of such systems can transform them into intelligent machines which, for instance, could use sensory neurons to detect environmental cues then adaptively respond and orchestrate various motor patterns through their neural circuitry. However, achieving such sensory-motor modalities relies on the ability of neural units to command muscle activity, making actuation through motor neurons the first milestone. Here, we achieve this milestone and demonstrate neuromuscular actuation of a biohybrid swimmer. This paves the way for the development of biohybrid embodied platforms as models to gain deeper understanding of motor control, with potentially broad impact in robotics, bioengineering, and health.           ,              The integration of muscle cells with soft robotics in recent years has led to the development of biohybrid machines capable of untethered locomotion. A major frontier that currently remains unexplored is neuronal actuation and control of such muscle-powered biohybrid machines. As a step toward this goal, we present here a biohybrid swimmer driven by on-board neuromuscular units. The body of the swimmer consists of a free-standing soft scaffold, skeletal muscle tissue, and optogenetic stem cell-derived neural cluster containing motor neurons. Myoblasts embedded in extracellular matrix self-organize into a muscle tissue guided by the geometry of the scaffold, and the resulting muscle tissue is cocultured in situ with a neural cluster. Motor neurons then extend neurites selectively toward the muscle and innervate it, developing functional neuromuscular units. Based on this initial construct, we computationally designed, optimized, and implemented light-sensitive flagellar swimmers actuated by these neuromuscular units. Cyclic muscle contractions, induced by neural stimulation, drive time-irreversible flagellar dynamics, thereby providing thrust for untethered forward locomotion of the swimmer. Overall, this work demonstrates an example of a biohybrid robot implementing neuromuscular actuation and illustrates a path toward the forward design and control of neuron-enabled biohybrid machines.},

Furthermore, exploiting the nature of the resulting model as being a continuous version of the Newton-Euler model of discrete robots, an algorithm is proposed which is capable of computing the internal control torques (and/or forces) as well as the rigid net motions of the robot. In general, this algorithm requires a model of the external forces (responsible for the self propulsion), but we will see how such a model can be replaced by a kinematic model of a combination of contacts related to terrestrial locomotion. Finally, in this case, that we name "kinematic locomotion", the algorithm is illustrated through many examples directly related to elongated body animals such as snakes, worms or caterpillars and their associated bio-mimetic artifacts.},

  abstract = {Since they were introduced in the 1990s, Lie group integrators have become a method of choice in many application areas. These include multibody dynamics, shape analysis, data science, image registration and biophysical simulations. Two important classes of intrinsic Lie group integrators are the Runge\textendash Kutta\textendash Munthe\textendash Kaas methods and the commutator free Lie group integrators. We give a short introduction to these classes of methods. The Hamiltonian framework is attractive for many mechanical problems, and in particular we shall consider Lie group integrators for problems on cotangent bundles of Lie groups where a number of different formulations are possible. There is a natural symplectic structure on such manifolds and through variational principles one may derive symplectic Lie group integrators. We also consider the practical aspects of the implementation of Lie group integrators, such as adaptive time stepping. The theory is illustrated by applying the methods to two nontrivial applications in mechanics. One is the N-fold spherical pendulum where we introduce the restriction of the adjoint action of the group SE(3) to TS2, the tangent bundle of the two-dimensional sphere. Finally, we show how Lie group integrators can be applied to model the controlled path of a payload being transported by two rotors. This problem is modelled on R6 \texttimes{} (SO(3) \texttimes{} so(3))2 \texttimes{} (TS2)2 and put in a format where Lie group integrators can be applied.},

Particular attention is given to critical phenomena and renormalization group methods. The properties of liquids, liquid crystals, quasicrystals, crystalline solids, magnetically ordered systems and amorphous solids are investigated in terms of their symmetry, generalised rigidity, hydrodynamics and topological defect structure.

  abstract = {The method of moving frames originated in the early nineteenth century with the notion of the Frenet frame along a curve in Euclidean space. Later, Darboux expanded this idea to the study of surfaces. The method was brought to its full power in the early twentieth century by Elie Cartan, and its development continues today with the work of Fels, Olver, and others. This book is an introduction to the method of moving frames as developed by Cartan, at a level suitable for beginning graduate students familiar with the geometry of curves and surfaces in Euclidean space. The main focus is on the use of this method to compute local geometric invariants for curves and surfaces in various 3-dimensional homogeneous spaces, including Euclidean, Minkowski, equi-affine, and projective spaces. Later chapters include applications to several classical problems in differential geometry, as well as an introduction to the nonhomogeneous case via moving frames on Riemannian manifolds. The book is written in a reader-friendly style, building on already familiar concepts from curves and surfaces in Euclidean space. A special feature of this book is the inclusion of detailed guidance regarding the use of the computer algebra system Maple"!to perform many of the computations involved in the exercises. An excellent and unique graduate level exposition of the differential geometry of curves, surfaces and higher-dimensional submanifolds of homogeneous spaces based on the powerful and elegant method of moving frames. The treatment is self-contained and illustrated through a large number of examples and exercises, augmented by Maple code to assist in both concrete calculations and plotting. Highly recommended. --Niky Kamran, McGill University The method of moving frames has seen a tremendous explosion of research activity in recent years, expanding into many new areas of applications, from computer vision to the calculus of variations to geometric partial differential equations to geometric numerical integration schemes to classical invariant theory to integrable systems to infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-groups and beyond. Cartan theory remains a touchstone in modern differential geometry, and Clelland's book provides a fine new introduction that includes both classic and contemporary geometric developments and is supplemented by Maple symbolic software routines that enable the reader to both tackle the exercises and delve further into this fascinating and important field of contemporary mathematics. Recommended for students and researchers wishing to expand their geometric horizons. --Peter Olver, University of Minnesota.},

  abstract = {Understanding looping probabilities, including the particular case of ring closure or cyclization, of fluctuating polymers (e.g., DNA) is important in many applications in molecular biology and chemistry. In a continuum limit the configuration of a polymer is a curve in the group SE(3) of rigid body displacements, whose energy can be modeled via the Cosserat theory of elastic rods. Cosserat rods are a more detailed version of the classic wormlike-chain (WLC) model, which we show to be more appropriate in short-length scale, or stiff, regimes, where the contributions of extension and shear deformations are not negligible and lead to noteworthy high values for the cyclization probabilities (or J-factors). We therefore observe that the Cosserat framework is a candidate for gaining a better understanding of the enhanced cyclization of short DNA molecules reported in various experiments, which is not satisfactorily explained by WLC-type models. Characterizing the stochastic fluctuations about minimizers of the energy by means of Laplace expansions in a (real) path integral formulation, we develop efficient analytical approximations for the two cases of full looping, in which both end-to-end relative translation and rotation are prescribed, and of marginal looping probabilities, where only end-to-end translation is prescribed. For isotropic Cosserat rods, certain looping boundary value problems admit nonisolated families of critical points of the energy due to an associated continuous symmetry. For the first time, taking inspiration from (imaginary) path integral techniques, a quantum mechanical probabilistic treatment of Goldstone modes in statistical rod mechanics sheds light on J-factor computations for isotropic rods in the semiclassical context. All the results are achieved exploiting appropriate Jacobi fields arising from Gaussian path integrals and show good agreement when compared with intense Monte Carlo simulations for the target examples.},

For this purpose, an elasto-plastic Cosserat continuum model (EPCCM) and finite element method (FEM) in the updated Lagrange frame are employed. Plane quasi-static shearing of a granular soil layer, bounded by upper and lower rigid boundaries with different surface roughness conditions, is simulated under free dilatancy and constant vertical pressure. Herein, the additional Cosserat kinematical boundary constraints along the bounding surfaces allow a more detailed description of the surface roughness. Specific emphasis is given to the effects of surface roughness as well as the boundary conditions of the entire system on the shear behaviour of layer. According to the obtained results, the shear band location is different in an infinite or finite shear layer depending on the adopted boundary constraints. Further numerical simulations of plane interface shearing are also carried out here using discrete element method (DEM), complementary to Cosserat FE analyses, to better understand the micro-mechanics of granular media near interfaces. FE results are compared with those of experiments as well as DEM simulations and reasonable agreements are seen. The evolution and distribution of state variables and polar quantities in DEM simulations are in proper accordance with the predictions of Cosserat FE model.},

The method also leads to complete classifications of generating systems of differential invariants, explicit commutation formulae for the associated invariant differential operators, and a general classification theorem for syzygies of the higher order differentiated differential invariants. A variety of illustrative examples demonstrate how the method can be directly applied to practical problems arising in geometry, invariant theory, and differential equations.},

In this paper, we formulate a practical and easy to implement explicit method to compute moving frames, invariant differential forms, differential invariants and invariant differential operators, and solve general equivalence problems for both finite-dimensional Lie group actions and infinite Lie pseudo-groups. A wide variety of applications, ranging from differential equations to differential geometry to computer vision are presented.

  abstract = {Classical homogenization techniques are not designed to predict the effect of the size of the constituents on the effective mechanical behaviour of heterogeneous materials. They usually take the volume fraction and, in some cases, the morphology of phase distribution into account. This shortcoming is related to the fact that, in crystals, the elastoviscoplastic behaviour of each constituent within the aggregate may be different from that observed on the constituent alone (say the single crystal). Cosserat single crystal plasticity is used in this work to describe the influence of grain size on the effective hardening behaviour of polycrystals. For that purpose, three-dimensional finite element calculations of periodic Cosserat multi-crystalline aggregates of different grain sizes are provided. The polycrystal is regarded as a heterogeneous Cosserat medium and specific techniques for the estimation of the effective properties are presented. The approach is then applied to the case of two-phase single crystal materials for which the behaviour of one phase as a matrix turns out to be much harder than the isolated phase.},

  abstract = {The primary goal of these lectures is to introduce a beginner to the finite dimensional representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Since this goal is shared by quite a few other books, we should explain in this Preface how our approach differs, although the potential reader can probably see this better by a quick browse through the book. Representation theory is simple to define: it is the study of the ways in which a given group may act on vector spaces. It is almost certainly unique, however, among such clearly delineated subjects, in the breadth of its interest to mathematicians. This is not surprising: group actions are ubiquitous in 20th century mathematics, and where the object on which a group acts is not a vector space, we have learned to replace it by one that is \{e. g. , a cohomology group, tangent space, etc. \}. As a consequence, many mathematicians other than specialists in the field \{or even those who think they might want to be\} come in contact with the subject in various ways. It is for such people that this text is designed. To put it another way, we intend this as a book for beginners to learn from and not as a reference. This idea essentially determines the choice of material covered here. As simple as is the definition of representation theory given above, it fragments considerably when we try to get more specific.},

  abstract = {The motion of filament-like structures in fluid media has been a topic of interest since long. In this regard, a well known slender body theory exists, wherein the fluid flow is assumed to be Stokesian while the filament is modeled as a Kirchhoff rod which can bend and twist but remains inextensible and unshearable. In this work, we relax the inextensibility and unshearability constraints on filaments, i.e., the filament is modeled as a special Cosserat rod. Starting with the boundary integral formulation of Stokes flow involving the filament?s surface velocity and fluid traction that acts on the filament surface, the method of matched asymptotic expansion is used to first obtain a leading-order representation of the boundary integral kernels in the filament?s aspect ratio. We then substitute Fourier series expansion (in filament?s circumferential coordinate) of both the filament?s surface velocity and fluid traction in the aforementioned leading-order representation and further linearize it in the rod?s shear strains to reduce the two-dimensional boundary integral over the filament surface into a line integral over the filament?s centerline. Upon further collecting the coefficients of sine and cosine terms, the zeroth-order Fourier mode yields a line integral equation relating the rod?s centerline velocity with the distributed fluid force that acts on the filament. The presence of line integral makes the relation non-local in nature. On the contrary, the first-order Fourier mode yields a simpler local relation between the rod?s angular velocity and the distributed fluid couple. The line integral equation is shown to reduce to the classical slender body theory when shear strains and axial strain are set to zero. The non-dimensional governing equations of the special Cosserat rod are also derived accounting for the distributed fluid force and distributed fluid couple in them which are solved to obtain the filament motion. The presented theory is demonstrated with an example problem of the tumbling of filaments in background shear flow. We show that for relatively shorter filaments where the effect of shear and axial stretch is more dominant, the obtained results deviate from the ones based on the classical slender body theory.},

  abstract = {In general relativity, the Gibbons\textendash Hawking\textendash York boundary term is a term that needs to be added to the Einstein\textendash Hilbert action when the underlying spacetime manifold has a boundary. The Einstein\textendash Hilbert action is the basis for the most elementary variational principle from which the field equations of general relativity can be defined. However, the use of the Einstein\textendash Hilbert action is appropriate only when the underlying spacetime manifold                                                 M                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle \{\textbackslash mathcal \{M\}\}\}    is closed, i.e., a manifold which is both compact and without boundary.

There remains ambiguity in the action up to an arbitrary functional of the induced metric                                    h                        a             b                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle h\_\{ab\}\}   . That a boundary term is needed in the gravitational case is because                         R                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle R\}   , the gravitational Lagrangian density, contains second derivatives of the metric tensor. This is a non-typical feature of field theories, which are usually formulated in terms of Lagrangians that involve first derivatives of fields to be varied over only. The GHY term is desirable, as it possesses a number of other key features. When passing to the Hamiltonian formalism, it is necessary to include the GHY term in order to reproduce the correct Arnowitt\textendash Deser\textendash Misner energy (ADM energy). The term is required to ensure the path integral (a la Hawking) for quantum gravity has the correct composition properties. When calculating black hole entropy using the Euclidean semiclassical approach, the entire contribution comes from the GHY term. This term has had more recent applications in loop quantum gravity in calculating transition amplitudes and background-independent scattering amplitudes. In order to determine a finite value for the action, one may have to subtract off a surface term for flat spacetime:                                   S                        E             H                             +                    S                        G             H             Y             ,             0                             =                                 1                            16               {$\pi$}                                                     {$\int$}                                       M                                                                  d                                   4                             x                                          -             g                             R         +                                 1                            8               {$\pi$}                                                     {$\int$}                        {$\partial$}                                             M                                                                                 d                                   3                             y                  {$\epsilon$}                                 h                             K         -                                 1                            8               {$\pi$}                                                     {$\int$}                        {$\partial$}                                             M                                                                                 d                                   3                             y                  {$\epsilon$}                                 h                                        K                        0                             ,                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle S\_\{EH\}+S\_\{GHY,0\}=\{\textbackslash frac \{1\}\{16\textbackslash pi \}\}\textbackslash int \_\{\textbackslash mathcal \{M\}\}\textbackslash mathrm \{d\} \^\{4\}x\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash sqrt \{-g\}\}R+\{\textbackslash frac \{1\}\{8\textbackslash pi \}\}\textbackslash int \_\{\textbackslash partial \{\textbackslash mathcal \{M\}\}\}\textbackslash mathrm \{d\} \^\{3\}y\textbackslash,\textbackslash epsilon \{\textbackslash sqrt \{h\}\}K-\{1 \textbackslash over 8\textbackslash pi \}\textbackslash int \_\{\textbackslash partial \{\textbackslash mathcal \{M\}\}\}\textbackslash mathrm \{d\} \^\{3\}y\textbackslash,\textbackslash epsilon \{\textbackslash sqrt \{h\}\}K\_\{0\},\}   where                                    K                        0                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle K\_\{0\}\}    is the extrinsic curvature of the boundary imbedded flat spacetime.

  abstract = {We discuss how the shape of a special Cosserat rod can be represented as a path in the special Euclidean algebra. By shape we mean all those geometric features that are invariant under isometries of the three-dimensional ambient space. The representation of the shape as a path in the special Euclidean algebra is intrinsic to the description of the mechanical properties of a rod, since it is given directly in terms of the strain fields that stimulate the elastic response of special Cosserat rods. Moreover, such a representation leads naturally to discretization schemes that avoid the need for the expensive reconstruction of the strains from the discretized placement and for interpolation procedures which introduce some arbitrariness in popular numerical schemes. Given the shape of a rod and the positioning of one of its cross sections, the full placement in the ambient space can be uniquely reconstructed and described by means of a base curve endowed with a material frame. By viewing a geometric curve as a rod with degenerate point-like cross sections, we highlight the essential difference between rods and framed curves, and clarify why the family of relatively parallel adapted frames is not suitable for describing the mechanics of rods but is the appropriate tool for dealing with the geometry of curves.},

  abstract = {We propose a method for the description and simulation of the nonlinear dynamics of slender structures modeled as Cosserat rods. It is based on interpreting the strains and the generalized velocities of the cross sections as basic variables and elements of the special Euclidean algebra. This perspective emerges naturally from the evolution equations for strands, that are one-dimensional submanifolds, of the special Euclidean group. The discretization of the corresponding equations for the three-dimensional motion of a Cosserat rod is performed, in space, by using a staggered grid. The time evolution is then approximated with a semi-implicit method. Within this approach we can easily include dissipative effects due to both the action of external forces and the presence of internal mechanical dissipation. The comparison with results obtained with different schemes shows the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to provide very good predictions of nonlinear dynamical effects and shows competitive computation times also as an energy-minimizing method to treat static problems.},

Our approach consists in reducing the three-dimensional strain-energy density of a nematic cylindrical structure to a one-dimensional energy of a nematic rod. The reduced one-dimensional model connects directly the optothermal stimulation to the generation of intrinsic curvature, extension, torsion, and twist, and is applicable to a wide range of liquid crystalline rods subject to external stimuli and mechanical loads. For illustration, we obtain the shape of a clamped rod under uniform illumination, and compute the instability of an illuminated rod under tensile load. This general framework can be used to determine the shape and instabilities of nematic rods with different cross-sections or different alignment of the nematic field.},

In this article we present the deformation space formulation for soft robots dynamics, developed using a finite element approach. Starting from the Cosserat rod theory formulated on a Lie group, we derive a discrete model using a helicoidal shape function for the spatial discretization and a geometric scheme for the time integration of the robot shape configuration. The main motivation behind this work is the derivation of accurate and computational efficient models for soft robots. The model takes into account bending, torsion, shear, and axial deformations due to general external loading conditions. It is validated through analytic and experimental benchmark. The results demonstrate that the model matches experimental positions with errors {$<$}1\% of the robot length. The computer implementation of the model results in SimSOFT, a dynamic simulation environment for design, analysis, and control of soft robots.},

However, studies of such complex active systems are limited, particularly from the experimental side. Here we report magnetically actuated, soft, artificial cilia carpets. By stretching and folding onto curved templates, programmable magnetization patterns can be encoded into artificial cilia carpets, which exhibit metachronal waves in dynamic magnetic fields. We have tested both the transport capabilities in a fluid environment and the locomotion capabilities on a solid surface. This robotic system provides a highly customizable experimental platform that not only assists in understanding fundamental rules of natural cilia carpets, but also paves a path to cilia-inspired soft robots for future biomedical applications.},

While many of these systems move in a wide, three-dimensional environment, several biological systems are confined by a curved topology. The role played by a non-Euclidean geometry on the self-organization of active systems is not yet fully understood, and few experimental systems are available to study it. Here, we introduce an experimental setup in which actin filaments glide on the inner surface of a spherical lipid vesicle, thus embedding them in a curved geometry. We show that filaments self-assemble into polar, elongated structures and that, when these match the size of the spherical geometry, both confinement and topological constraints become relevant for the emergent patterns, leading to the formation of polar vortices and jammed states. These results experimentally demonstrate that activity-induced complex patterns can be shaped by spherical confinement and topology.},

The bar is made of an inhomogeneous and isotropic material whose constitutive coefficients are independent of the axial coordinate. The problem is reduced to the study of two-dimensional problems. The results are used to study two practical applications concerning the deformation of a circular rod. It is shown that a uniform pressure on the lateral surface produces an extension, a uniform change of the porosity, and a plane deformation. The bending by terminal couples produces a non-uniform variation of the porosity and a microrotation of the material particles.},

One of the well-known shell elements based on the Cosserat shell theory is the four-node element presented by Simo et al. [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 72 (1989) 267; 73 (1989) 53]. Although one could use this element, the use of lower-order elements often results in instabilities (such as the ``checkerboard'' instability) in the resulting topologies; this provides the motivation for developing higher-order shell elements based on a classical shell theory. In this work, we present the formulation and implementation details for six-node and seven-node triangular, and nine-node quadrilateral shell elements, which are based on the variational formulation of Simo et al., and show that good accuracy is obtained even with coarse meshes in fairly demanding problems. We also present the topology optimization formulation, and some examples of optimal topologies that are obtained using this formulation.},

This process is fundamental in morphogenesis but also in plant tropism, nematic solid activation, and muscular motion of filamentary organs such as elephant trunks and octopus arms. Here, we provide a general theory that links the activation of arbitrary fibers at the microscale to the generation of curvature and torsion at the macroscale. This theory is obtained by dimensional reduction from the full anelastic description of three-dimensional bodies to morphoelastic Kirchhoff rods. Hence, it links the geometry and material properties of embedded fibers to the shape and stiffness of the rod. The theory is applied to fibers that are wound helically around a central core in tapered and untapered filaments.},

  abstract = {This thesis is devoted to algorithmic aspects of the implementation of Cartan's moving frame method to the problem of the equivalence of submanifolds under a Lie group action. We adopt a general definition of a moving frame as an equivariant map from the space of submanifolds to the group itself and introduce two algorithms, which simplify the construction of such maps. The first algorithm is applicable when the group factors as a product of two subgroups \$G=BA\$, allowing us to use moving frames and differential invariants for the groups \$A\$ and \$B\$ in order to construct a moving frame and differential invariants for \$G\$. This approach produces the relations among the invariants of \$G\$ and its subgroups. We use the groups of the projective, the affine and the Euclidean transformations on the plane to illustrate the algorithm. We also introduce a recursive algorithm, allowing, provided the group action satisfies certain conditions, to construct differential invariants order by order, at each step normalizing more and more of the group parameters, at the end obtaining a moving frame for the entire group. The development of this algorithm has been motivated by the applications of the moving frame method to the problems of the equivalence and symmetry of polynomials under linear changes of variables. In the complex or real case these problems can be reduced and, in theory, completely solved as the problem of the equivalence of submanifolds. Its solution however involves algorithms based on the Gr\textbackslash "obner basis computations, which due to their complexity, are not always feasible. Nevertheless, some interesting new results were obtained, such as a classification of ternary cubics and their groups of symmetries, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for a homogeneous polynomial in three variables to be equivalent to \$x\^n+y\^n+z\^n.\$},

The interplay between the spontaneous fluid flow, Brownian motion, and the elasticity of the body presents a challenging fluid\textendash structure interaction problem. Here, we model this problem by approximating the slender body as an elastic filament that can impose non-equilibrium velocities or stresses at the fluid\textendash structure interface. We derive equations of motion for such an active filament by enforcing momentum conservation in the fluid\textendash structure interaction and assuming slow viscous flow in the fluid. The fluid\textendash structure interaction is obtained, to any desired degree of accuracy, through the solution of an integral equation. A simplified form of the equations of motion, which allows for efficient numerical solutions, is obtained by applying the Kirkwood\textendash Riseman superposition approximation to the integral equation. We use this form of equation of motion to study dynamical steady states in free and hinged minimally active filaments. Our model provides the foundation to study collective phenomena in momentum-conserving, Brownian, active filament suspensions.},

Linear states are destabilised by buckling instabilities to produce stable states of non-zero curvature and writhe. We demarcate boundaries of these states in the two-dimensional parameter space representing dimensionless measures of polar and apolar activity. Our proposed assembly can be used as a novel component in the design of micro-machines at low Reynolds number and to study elastic instabilities driven by `follower' forces.},

In the presence of activity, the latter must be augmented by forces that cause spontaneous chain motion and fluid flow. Here, using such augmented Langevin equations, we study active polymeric solutions and melts composed of chains of hydrodynamically interacting stresslets. In a spherical volume, contractile chains are unstable and self-knot into entangled melts at both low and high densities. Extensile chains in the same geometry form an unentangled reptating state at low densities and an entangled, coherently moving, non-reptating state at high densities. On a spherical surface, contractile chains show transitions, with increasing areal density, between isotropic, orientationally ordered and micro-phase separated states. Extensile chains in the same geometry show a transition between isotropic and nematic states. In both cases, defects in orientationally ordered states are produced athermally and without conserving topological charge. Our work reproduces the phenomenology of several recent experiments, highlights the importance of hydrodynamic interactions in active polymer fluids, and suggests non-equilibrium kinetic routes to topological structures that are otherwise difficult to obtain in equilibrium.},

We achieve our results by extending the powerful symbolic invariant calculus for Lie group\textendash based moving frames, to the Rotation Minimizing frame case. To date, the invariant calculus has been developed for frames defined by algebraic equations. By contrast, the Rotation Minimizing frame is defined by a differential equation. In this paper, we derive the recurrence formulae for the symbolic invariant differentiation of the symbolic invariants. We then derive the syzygy operator needed to obtain Noether's conservation laws as well as the Euler\textendash Lagrange equations directly in terms of the invariants, for variational problems with a Euclidean symmetry. We show how to use the six Noether laws to ease the integration problem for the minimizing curve, once the Euler\textendash Lagrange equations have been solved for the generating differential invariants.

  abstract = {Symmetry has always played an important role in mechanics, from fundamental formulations of basic principles to concrete applications. The theme of the book is to develop the basic theory and applications of mechanics with an emphasis on the role of symmetry. In recent times, the interest in mechanics, and in symmetry techniques in particular, has accelerated because of developments in dynamical systems, the use of geometric methods and new applications to integrable and chaotic systems, control systems, stability and bifurcation, and the study of specific rigid, fluid, plasma and elastic systems. Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry lays the basic foundation for these topics and includes numerous specific applications, making it beneficial to physicists and engineers. This text has specific examples and applications showing how the theory works, and up-to-date techniques, all of which makes it accessible to a wide variety of readers, expecially senior undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, physics and engineering. For this second edition, the text has been rewritten and updated for clarity throughout, with a major revamping and expansion of the exercises. Internet supplements containing additional material are also available on-line.},

Frictional models based on the classical continuum do not predict the occurrence of shear layers, in contrast to experimental observations. This feature has been attributed to the absence of a material length scale in their constitutive equations. The present model incorporates such a material length scale by treating the granular material as a Cosserat continuum. Thus, localized couple stresses exist, and the stress tensor is asymmetric. The velocity profiles predicted by the model are in close agreement with available experimental data. The predicted dependence of the shear layer thickness on the width of the channel is in reasonable agreement with data. In the limit of small {$\epsilon$} (ratio of the particle diameter to the half-width of the channel), the model predicts that the shear layer thickness scaled by the particle diameter grows as {$\varepsilon$}-1/3.},

After precise estimates for (local) moderate rotation and relative displacement gradients in terms of infinitesimal strain have been effected, a complete theory is formulated with the use of linear constitutive equations. The nature of the complete theory is further examined when initially the shell-like body is a plate; and it is shown that our kinematical formulae (strain-displacement relations), as well as the relevant differential equations of the theory in the absence of the effect of transverse normal strain, systematically reduce to those used in the von K\'arm\'an plate equations. Also, in the light of the present results, an assessment of kinematical aspects of previously developed theories of shells undergoing small strain and moderate rotation is indicated.},

This is partly due to the scarcity of models and simulators able to capture their complex continuum mechanics, resulting in a lack of control methodologies that take full advantage of body compliance. Currently available methods are either too computational demanding or overly simplistic in their physical assumptions, leading to a paucity of available simulation resources for developing such control schemes. To address this, we introduce Elastica, an open-source simulation environment modeling the dynamics of soft, slender rods that can bend, twist, shear, and stretch. We couple Elastica with five state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms (TRPO, PPO, DDPG, TD3, and SAC). We successfully demonstrate distributed, dynamic control of a soft robotic arm in four scenarios with both large action spaces, where RL learning is difficult, and small action spaces, where the RL actor must learn to interact with its environment. Training converges in 10 million policy evaluations with near real-time evaluation of learned policies.},

  abstract = {This contribution is concerned with a consistent formal dimensional reduction of a previously introduced finite-strain three-dimensional Cosserat micropolar elasticity model to the two-dimensional situation of thin plates and shells. Contrary to the direct modelling of a shell as a Cosserat surface with additional directors, we obtain the shell model from the Cosserat bulk model which already includes a triad of rigid directors. The reduction is achieved by assumed kinematics, quadratic through the thickness. The three-dimensional transverse boundary conditions can be evaluated analytically in terms of the assumed kinematics and determines exactly two appearing coefficients in the chosen ansatz. Further simplifications with subsequent analytical integration through the thickness determine the reduced model in a variational setting. The resulting membrane energy turns out to be a quadratic, elliptic, first order, non degenerate energy in contrast to classical approaches. The bending contribution is augmented by a curvature term representing an additional stiffness of the Cosserat model and the corresponding system of balance equations remains of second order. The lateral boundary conditions for simple support are non-standard. The model includes size-effects, transverse shear resistance, drilling degrees of freedom and accounts implicitly for thickness extension and asymmetric shift of the midsurface. The formal thin shell ``membrane'' limit without classical h3-bending term is non-degenerate due to the additional Cosserat curvature stiffness and control of drill rotations. In our formulation, the drill-rotations are strictly related to the size-effects of the bulk model and not introduced artificially for numerical convenience. Upon linearization with zero Cosserat couple modulus \textmu c = 0 we recover the well known infinitesimal-displacement Reissner-Mindlin model without size-effects and without drill-rotations. It is shown that the dimensionally reduced Cosserat formulation is well-posed for positive Cosserat couple modulus \textmu c {$>$} 0 by means of the direct methods of variations along the same line of argument which showed the well-posedness of the three-dimensional Cosserat bulk model [72].},

For these two classes of problems the equations of the classical theory of rods are reduced to a non-linear vector equation of motion together with the inextensibility condition and appropriate boundary and initial conditions. Consistent finite-difference approximations are introduced and a semi-explicit method of solution is devised. The approximate limitation for numerical stability of the method is shown to be the same as for the usual explicit method in linear beam dynamics. By way of example the method is applied to the free fall of a circular pipe through water onto a rigid plane from a suspended initial configuration.},

Therefore, the incorporation of the micropolar media into numerical approaches for the analysis of materials with a complex microstructure looks necessary. So far, most studies utilize Cosserat continuum theory with 3D finite solid elements, even though, it covers only few beam elements developed within a linear strain\textendash displacement relationship, and therefore only works in a small deformation regime. In this study, the authors aim to develop a size-dependent 3D continuum beam element based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) with microstructure inclusions. Comparing analytical solutions within the Cosserat continuum model and models based on the proposed and already existing 3D micropolar solid elements, one can see a good correlation between them, with a faster convergence rate for the developed ANCF beam element. That allows exploiting the developed beam element within the non-linear deformation range, which is usually bypassed because of high computational costs, thus, accounting fully for differences between two media descriptions.},

These numerical integration schemes for differential equations on manifolds have been studied in a general and systematic manner since the 1990s and the activity has since then branched out in several different subareas, focussing both on theoretical and practical issues. From two alternative setups, using either frames or Lie group actions on a manifold, we here introduce the most important classes of schemes used to integrate nonlinear ordinary differential equations on Lie groups and manifolds. We describe a number of different applications where there is a natural action by a Lie group on a manifold such that our integrators can be implemented. An issue which is not well understood is the role of isotropy and how it affects the behaviour of the numerical methods. The order theory of numerical Lie group integrators has become an advanced subtopic in its own right, and here we give a brief introduction on a somewhat elementary level. Finally, we shall discuss Lie group integrators having the property that they preserve a symplectic structure or a first integral.},

Specifically, in wet bone at small strain, significant deviations from the classically predicted strain distribution were observed. The measured strain distribution in wet bone followed predictions based on Cosserat (micropolar) elasticity. In dry bone, the strain distribution was very close to the prediction of classical elasticity. The interaction between Haversian osteons and the cement substance between them was hypothesized to be the principal mechanism for the phenomena. To evaluate this hypothesis, additional specimens were subjected to prolonged torsional load and the cement lines were observed by reflected light microscopy. Localized deformation at the cement lines was observed, but it was less than values reported earlier for bovine plexiform bone.},

Finally, we discuss the coupling between individual distortions and curvature from the perspective of Lie algebras and groups and describe homogeneous spaces on which pure modes of distortion can be realised.},

Although these materials are highly compliant, they are prone to structural and surface instabilities. Buckling, rupture, wrinkling and fracture are some consequences of these instabilities. Under the influence of self-weight and external axial loads, slender hydrogels show viscoelastic buckling. In this paper, the time-dependent response of hydrogels under these conditions has been modelled by considering the energy on account of bending, the work done due to self-weight and external loads, and the viscous damping effects. A Prony series has been used to characterize the compliance and capture the viscoelastic nature of the hydrogels. The parameters of the Prony series were calculated by assuming the hydrogel to be a 3\textendash 3 composite. The governing differential equations have been derived using a variational technique. Components of the model have been verified using recorded experimental findings. The model predictions have been reported and a parametric study has been carried out to understand the effect of different system parameters such as the axial load, density and compliance on the viscoelastic response of slender hydrogels.},

  abstract = {Large scale changes to lipid bilayer shapes are well represented by the Helfrich model. However, there are membrane processes that take place at smaller length scales that this model cannot address. In this work, we present a one-dimensional continuum model that captures the mechanics of the lipid bilayer membrane at the length scale of the lipids themselves. The model is developed using the Cosserat theory of surfaces with lipid orientation, or 'tilt', as the fundamental degree of freedom. The Helfrich model can be recovered as a special case when the curvatures are small and the lipid tilt is everywhere zero. We use the tilt model to study local membrane deformations in response to a protein inclusion. Parameter estimates and boundary conditions are obtained from a coarse-grained molecular model using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to capture the same phenomenon. The continuum model is able to reproduce the membrane bending, stretch and lipid tilt as seen in the DPD model. The lipid tilt angle relaxes to the bulk tilt angle within 5-6 nm from the protein inclusion. Importantly, for large tilt gradients induced by the proteins, the tilt energy contribution is larger than the bending energy contribution. Thus, the continuum model of tilt accurately captures behaviors at length scales shorter than the membrane thickness.},

From another point of view, the rod is considered to be a material curve C which has some finite thickness bounded by the rod's lateral surface. If this curve C is a straight line, then the rod-like structure is called a beam, otherwise it is called a rod. Such rod-like structures appear in practice in many applications.

  abstract = {Classically, the elastic behaviour of cardiac tissue mechanics is modelled using anisotropic strain energy functions capturing the averaged behaviour of its fibrous micro-structure. The strain energy function can be derived via representation theorems for anisotropic functions where a suitable non-linear strain tensor, e.g. the Green strain tensor, describes locally the current state of strain (Holzapfel, Ogden, 2009, Zheng, 1994). These approaches are usually of phenomenological nature and do not elucidate on the complex heterogeneous material composition of cardiac tissue (Rosenberg and Cimrman, 2003). In this research the fibrous characteristics of the myocardium are modelled by one-dimensional Cosserat continua. This additionally allows for the inclusion of non-local effects due to the heterogeneous material composition at smaller scales. Specifically, the non-local material response is linked to higher-order deformation modes associated with twisting and bending of an assembly of muscle fibres arising from hierarchical multi-scale features within a representative volume element (RVE). In this sense, a scaling parameter characteristic for the tissue's underlying micro-structure, becomes a material parameter of the formulation. As the anisotropic material composition of the myocardium throughout the heart is highly non-uniform, the ability to implicitly account for scale-dependent torsion and bending effects in the constitutive law gives this approach an advanced material description over classical formulations. The assumed hyperelastic material behaviour of myocardial tissue is represented by a non-linear strain energy function which includes contributions linked to the Cosserat-fibre continuum and complementary terms which refer to the extra-cellular matrix. Utilising the Element-free Galerkin method, simulations of specimen shear cubes and the left ventricle undergoing passive filling are introduced to investigate ventricular tissue mechanics.},

The method reduces the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle to obtain a reduced constrained principle that determines Euler-Poincar\'e equations on the reduced space. The theory is demonstrated by deriving the reduced equations of motion for several examples of rigid bodies that roll without slipping. Our method of reduction is then used as a framework to obtain several results related to Chaplygin's sphere. The first result determines the stability of the relative equilibria of Chaplygin's sphere: the ball spins stably about the principal axes with the largest and smallest moments of inertia and unstably about the middle axis. The next results use two different approaches to stabilize the rotation of the ball about its middle axis. The first approach controls an internal rotor that has been added to the ball and the second approach controls the plane the ball rolls upon by forces of horizontal translations. We briefly consider the system where the plane is allowed to react to the motion of the ball, stating the equations of motion and identifying the steady rotations.},

It provides a basic introduction to theoretical physics as applied to soft matter, explaining the concepts of symmetry, broken symmetry, and order parameters; phases and phase transitions; mean-field theory; and the mathematics of variational calculus and tensors. It is written in an informal, conversational style, which is accessible to students from a diverse range of backgrounds. The book begins with a simple ``toy model'' to demonstrate the physical significance of free energy. It then introduces two standard theories of phase transitions\textemdash the Ising model for ferromagnetism and van der Waals theory of gases and liquids\textemdash and uses them to illustrate principles of statistical mechanics. From those examples, it moves on to discuss order, disorder, and broken symmetry in many states of matter, and to explain the theoretical methods that are used to model the phenomena. It concludes with a chapter on liquid crystals, which brings together all of these physical and mathematical concepts. The book is accompanied online by a set of ``interactive figures''\textemdash some allow readers to change parameters and see what happens to a graph, some allow readers to rotate a plot or other graphics in 3D, and some do both. These interactive figures help students to develop their intuition for the physical meaning of equations. This book will prepare advanced undergraduate or early graduate students to go into more advanced theoretical studies. It will also equip students going into experimental soft matter science to be fully conversant with the theoretical aspects and have effective collaborations with theorists.},

It introduces an organized approach to studying a new material system -- identify the broken symmetries, define the order parameter, examine the elementary excitations, and classify the topological defects. It uses order parameters to describe crystals and liquid crystals, superfluids and magnets. It touches upon broken gauge symmetries and the Anderson/Higgs mechanism and an analogue to braiding of non-abelian quantum particles. Exercises explore sound, second sound, and Goldstone's theorem; fingerprints and soccer balls; Landau theory and other methods for generating emergent theories from symmetries and commutation relations; topological defects in magnets, liquid crystals, and superfluids, and defect entanglement.},

  abstract = {Dynamic organization of the cytoskeletal filaments and rod-like proteins in the cell membrane and other biological interfaces occurs in many cellular processes. Previous modeling studies have considered the dynamics of a single rod on fluid planar membranes. We extend these studies to the more physiologically relevant case of a single filament moving in a spherical membrane. Specifically, we use a slender-body formulation to compute the translational and rotational resistance of a single filament of length \$L\$ moving in a membrane of radius \$R\$ and 2D viscosity \$\textbackslash eta\_m\$, and surrounded on its interior and exterior with Newtonian fluids of viscosities \$\textbackslash eta\^\{-\}\$ and \$\textbackslash eta\^\{+\}\$. We first discuss the case where the filament's curvature is at its minimum \$\textbackslash kappa=1/R\$. We show that the boundedness of spherical geometry gives rise to flow confinement effects that increase in strength with increasing the ratio of filament's length to membrane radius \$L/R\$. These confinement flows only result in a mild increase in filament's resistance along its axis, \$\textbackslash xi\_\{\textbackslash parallel\}\$, and its rotational resistance, \$\textbackslash xi\_\{\textbackslash Omega\}\$. As a result, our predictions of \$\textbackslash xi\_\textbackslash parallel\$ and \$\textbackslash xi\_\{\textbackslash Omega\}\$ can be quantitatively mapped to the results on a planar membrane. In contrast, we find that the drag in perpendicular direction, \$\textbackslash xi\_\textbackslash perp\$, increases superlinearly with the filament's length, when \$L/R {$>$}1\$ and ultimately \$\textbackslash xi\_\textbackslash perp \textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$ as \$L/R \textbackslash to \textbackslash pi\$. Next, we consider the effect of the filament's curvature, \$\textbackslash kappa\$, on its parallel motion, while fixing the membrane's radius. We show that the flow around the filament becomes increasingly more asymmetric with increasing its curvature. These flow asymmetries induce a net torque on the filament, coupling its parallel and rotational dynamics. This coupling becomes stronger with increasing \$L/R\$ and \$\textbackslash kappa\$.},

  abstract = {The variational formulation and computational aspects of a three-dimensional finite-strain rod model, considered in Part I, are presented. A particular parametrization is employed that bypasses the singularity typically associated with the use of Euler angles. As in the classical Kirchhoff-Love model, rotations have the standard interpretation of orthogonal, generally noncommutative, transformations. This is in contrast with alternative formulations proposed by Argyris et al. [5\textendash 8], based on the notion of semitangential rotation. Emphasis is placed on a geometric approach, which proves essential in the formulation of algorithms. In particular, the configuration update procedure becomes the algorithmic counterpart of the exponential map. The computational implementation relies on the formula for the exponential of a skew-symmetric matrix. Consistent linearization procedures are employed to obtain linearized weak forms of the balance equations. The geometric stiffness then becomes generally nonsymmetric as a result of the non-Euclidean character of the configuration space. However, complete symmetry is recovered at an equilibrium configuration, provided that the loading is conservative. An explicit condition for this to be the case is obtained. Numerical simulations including postbuckling behavior and nonconservative loading are also presented. Details pertaining to the implementation of the present formulation are also discussed.},

Cosserat continuum is a special case of what is called micromorphic, generalized or higher-order continua. Due to the presence of internal lengths in its formulation, Cosserat continuum is quite attractive for addressing problems involving strain localization. It enables modeling the shear band thickness evolution, tracking the postlocalization regime, and correctly dissipating the energy when using numerical schemes. In this chapter, we summarize the fundamental governing equations of a Cosserat continuum under multiphysical couplings. Several examples of the numerical advantages of Cosserat continuum are also presented regarding softening behavior, strain localization, finite element formulation, reduced integration, and hourglass control. The classically used constitutive models in Cosserat elastoplasticity are presented and some common approaches for upscaling and homogenization in Cosserat continuum are discussed. Finally, a simple illustrative example of the adiabatic shearing of a rock layer under constant shear stress is presented in order to juxtapose a rate-independent Cosserat with a rate-dependent Cauchy formulation as far as it concerns strain localization.},

Afterall, they willbe the professors ofthe twenty-first century and it would be absurd if they were to teach then the mathematics of the nineteenth century. Thus for this new edition I did not change the mathematical language. Apart from correcting some mistakes I have only added a section on gauge theories. In the last decade it has become evident that these theories describe fundamental interactions, and on the classical level their structure is suffi cientlyclear to qualify them for the minimum amount ofknowledge required by a theoretician. It is with much regret that I had to refrain from in corporating the interesting developments in Kaluza-Klein theories and in cosmology, but I felt bound to my promise not to burden the students with theoretical speculations for which there is no experimental evidence. I am indebted to many people for suggestions concerning this volume. In particular, P. Aichelburg, H. Rumpf and H. Urbantke have contributed generously to corrections and improvements.

In this work we present a numerical approach for forward dynamics simulation of Cosserat-based robot models in real time. The approach implicitly discretizes the time derivatives in the PDEs and then solves the resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE) boundary value problem (BVP) in arc length at each timestep. We show that this strategy can encompass a wide variety of robot models and numerical schemes in both time and space, with minimal symbolic manipulation required. Computational efficiency is gained owing to the stability of implicit methods at large timesteps, and implementation is relatively simple, which we demonstrate by providing a short MATLAB-coded example. We investigate and quantify the tradeoffs associated with several numerical subroutines, and we validate accuracy compared with dynamic rod data gathered with a high-speed camera system. To demonstrate the method?s application to continuum and soft robots, we derive several Cosserat-based dynamic models for robots using various actuation schemes (extensible rods, tendons, and fluidic chambers) and apply our approach to achieve real-time simulation in each case, with additional experimental validation on a tendon robot. Results show that these models capture several important phenomena, such as stability transitions and the effect of a compressible working fluid.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of slender filaments or fibers suspended in Stokesian fluids are fundamental to understanding many flows arising in physics, biology and engineering. Such filaments can have aspect ratios of length to radius ranging from a few tens to several thousands. Full discretizations of such 3D flows are very costly. Instead, we employ a non-local slender body theory that yields an integral equation, along the filament centerline, relating the force exerted on the body to the filament velocity. This hydrodynamical description takes into account the effect of the filament on the fluid, and is extended to capture the interaction of multiple filaments as mediated by the intervening fluid. We consider filaments that are inextensible and elastic. Replacing the force in the slender body integral equation by an explicit expression that uses Euler\textendash Bernoulli theory to model bending and tensile forces yields an integral expression for the velocity of the filament centerlines, coupled to auxiliary integro-differential equations for the filament tensions. Based on a regularized version of these slender body equations that is asymptotically equivalent to the original formulation, we construct a numerical method which uses a combination of finite differences, implicit time-stepping to avoid severe stability constraints, and special quadrature methods for nearly singular integrals. We present simulations of single flexible filaments, as well as multiple interacting filaments, evolving in a background shear flow. These simulations show shear induced buckling and relaxation of the filaments, leading to the storage and release of elastic energy. These dynamics are responsible for the development of positive first normal stress differences, commonly associated with visco-elastic fluids that are suspensions of microscopic elastic fibers.},

A single octopus arm is modeled as a Hamiltonian control system, where the continuum mechanics of the arm is modeled after the Cosserat rod theory, and internal, distributed muscle forces and couples are considered as controls. First order necessary optimality conditions are derived for an optimal control problem formulated for this infinite dimensional system. Solutions to this problem are obtained numerically by an iterative forward-backward algorithm. The state and adjoint equations are solved in a dynamic simulation environment, setting the stage for studying a broader class of optimal control problems.

Assuming that the system possesses symmetry and the configuration manifold corresponds to a Lie group, the Euler-Poincar\textasciiacute e reduction breaks up the motion into separate equations of dynamics and kinematics. This becomes of particular interest for modeling, estimation and control of mechanical systems. A control system generates an external force, which may break the symmetry in the dynamics.

  abstract = {Abstract             Natural creatures, from fish and cephalopods to snakes and birds, combine neural control, sensory feedback and compliant mechanics to effectively operate across dynamic, uncertain environments. In order to facilitate the understanding of the biophysical mechanisms at play and to streamline their potential use in engineering applications, we present here a versatile numerical approach to the simulation of musculoskeletal architectures. It relies on the assembly of heterogenous, active and passive Cosserat rods into dynamic structures that model bones, tendons, ligaments, fibers and muscle connectivity. We demonstrate its utility in a range of problems involving biological and soft robotic scenarios across scales and environments: from the engineering of millimeter-long bio-hybrid robots to the synthesis and reconstruction of complex musculoskeletal systems. The versatility of this~methodology offers a framework to aid forward and inverse bioengineering designs as well as fundamental discovery in the functioning of living organisms.},

	abstract = {This review provides a pedagogic and self-contained introduction to master equations and to their representation by path integrals. Since the 1930s, master equations have served as a fundamental tool to understand the role of fluctuations in complex biological, chemical, and physical systems. Despite their simple appearance, analyses of master equations most often rely on low-noise approximations such as the Kramers{\textendash}Moyal or the system size expansion, or require ad-hoc closure schemes for the derivation of low-order moment equations. We focus on numerical and analytical methods going beyond the low-noise limit and provide a unified framework for the study of master equations. After deriving the forward and backward master equations from the Chapman{\textendash}Kolmogorov equation, we show how the two master equations can be cast into either of four linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Three of these PDEs are discussed in detail. The first PDE governs the time evolution of a generalized probability generating function whose basis depends on the stochastic process under consideration. Spectral methods, WKB approximations, and a variational approach have been proposed for the analysis of the PDE. The second PDE is novel and is obeyed by a distribution that is marginalized over an initial state. It proves useful for the computation of mean extinction times. The third PDE describes the time evolution of a {\textquoteleft}generating functional{\textquoteright}, which generalizes the so-called Poisson representation. Subsequently, the solutions of the PDEs are expressed in terms of two path integrals: a {\textquoteleft}forward{\textquoteright} and a {\textquoteleft}backward{\textquoteright} path integral. Combined with inverse transformations, one obtains two distinct path integral representations of the conditional probability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path integrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Moreover, we show how a wellknown path integral representation of averaged observables can be recovered from them.},

	abstract = {In stochastic systems with weak noise, the logarithm of the stationary distribution becomes proportional to a large deviation rate function called the quasi-potential. The quasi-potential, and its characterization through a variational problem, lies at the core of the Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations theory [32]. In many interacting particle systems, the particle density is described by fluctuating hydrodynamics governed by Macroscopic Fluctuation Th?eory [6], which formally fits within Freidlin-Wentzell{\textquoteright}s framework with a weak noise proportional to 1/ N , where N is the number of particles. The quasi-potential then appears as a natural generalization of the equilibrium free energy to non-equilibrium particle systems. A key physical and practical issue is to actually compute quasi-potentials from their variational characterization for non-equilibrium systems for which detailed balance does not hold. We discuss how to perform such a computation perturbatively in an external parameter $\lambda$, starting from a known quasi-potential for $\lambda$ = 0. In a general setup, explicit iterative formulae for all terms of the power-series expansion of the quasi-potential are given for the first time. The key point is a proof of solvability conditions that assure the existence of the perturbation expansion to all orders. We apply the perturbative approach to diffusive particles interacting through a mean-field potential. For such systems, the variational characterization of the quasi-potential was proven by Dawson and Gartner [18, 19]. Our perturbative analysis provides new explicit results about the quasi-potential and about fluctuations of one-particle observables in a simple example of mean field diffusions: the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model of coupled rotators [74]. This is one of few systems for which non-equilibrium free energies can be computed and analyzed in an effective way, at least perturbatively.},

A direct singular perturbation analysis of the forward equation is presented, based on Kramers{\textquoteright} approach, in which the solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation is constructed, for a process with absorption at the boundary and a source at the attractor. In this formulation the boundary and matching conditions fully determine the uniform expansion of the solution, without resorting to "external" selection criteria for the expansion coefficients, such as variational principles or the Lagrange identity, as in our previous theory. The exit density and the mean first passage time to the boundary are calculated from the solution of the stationary Fokker-Planck equation as the probability current density and as the inverse of the total flux on the boundary, respectively. As an application, a uniform expansion is constructed for the escape rate in Kramers{\textquoteright} problem of activated escape from a potential well for the full range of the dissipation parameter.},

	abstract = {We revise the classical problem of characterizing first exit times of a harmonically trapped particle whose motion is described by a one- or multidimensional Ornstein{\textendash}Uhlenbeck process. We start by recalling the main derivation steps of a propagator using Langevin and Fokker{\textendash}Planck equations. The mean exit time, the moment-generating function and the survival probability are then expressed through confluent hypergeometric functions and thoroughly analyzed. We also present a rapidly converging series representation of confluent hypergeometric functions that is particularly well suited for numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the governing Fokker{\textendash}Planck operator. We discuss several applications of first exit times, such as the detection of time intervals during which motor proteins exert a constant force onto a tracer in optical tweezers single-particle tracking experiments; adhesion bond dissociation under mechanical stress; characterization of active periods of trend-following and mean-reverting strategies in algorithmic trading on stock markets; relation to the distribution of first crossing times of a moving boundary by Brownian motion. Some extensions are described, including diffusion under quadratic double-well potential and anomalous diffusion.},

	abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics like work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a localdetailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power, can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones like molecular motors, and heat engines like thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

	abstract = {In non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, the entropy production is used to describe flowing in or pumping out of the entropy of a time-dependent system. Even if a system is in a steady state (invariant in time), Prigogine suggested that there should be a positive entropy production if it is open. In 1979, the first author of this paper and Qian Min-Ping discovered that the entropy production describes the irreversibility of stationary Markov chains, and proved the circulation decomposition formula of the entropy production. They also obtained the entropy production formula for drifted Brownian motions on Euclidean space Rn (see a report without proof in the Proc. 1st World Congr. Bernoulli Soc.). By the topological triviality of Rn, there is no discrete circulation associated to the diffusion processes on Rn. In this paper, the entropy production formula for stationary drifted Brownian motions on a compact Riemannian manifold M is proved. Furthermore, the entropy production is decomposed into two parts {\textendash} in addition to the first part analogous to that of a diffusion process on Rn, some discrete circulations intrinsic to the topology of M appear! The first part is called the hidden circulation and is then explained as the circulation of a lifted process on M {\texttimes} S1 around the circle S1. The main result of this paper is the circulation decomposition formula which states that the entropy production of a stationary drifted Brownian motion on M is a linear sum of its circulations around the generators of the fundamental group of M and the hidden circulation.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of conditioning a Markov process on a rare event and of representing this conditioned process by a conditioningfree process, called the effective or driven process. The basic assumption is that the rare event used in the conditioning is a large deviation-type event, characterized by a convex rate function. Under this assumption, we construct the driven process via a generalization of Doob{\textquoteright}s h-transform, used in the context of bridge processes, and show that this process is equivalent to the conditioned process in the long-time limit. The notion of equivalence that we consider is based on the logarithmic equivalence of path measures and implies that the two processes have the same typical states. In constructing the driven process, we also prove equivalence with the so-called exponential tilting of the Markov process, often used with importance sampling to simulate rare events and giving rise, from the point of view of statistical mechanics, to a nonequilibrium version of the canonical ensemble. Other links between our results and the topics of bridge processes, quasi-stationary distributions, stochastic control, and conditional limit theorems are mentioned.},

	abstract = {We generalize the notion of Brownian bridge. More precisely, we study a standard Brownian motion for which a certain functional is conditioned to follow a given law. Such processes appear as weak solutions of stochastic di erential equations that we call conditioned stochastic di erential equations. The link with the theory of initial enlargement of {\"y}ltration is made and after a general presentation several examples are studied: the conditioning of a standard Brownian motion (and more generally of a Markov di usion) by its value at a given date, the conditioning of a geometric Brownian motion with negative drift by its quadratic variation and {\"y}nally the conditioning of a standard Brownian motion by its {\"y}rst hitting time of a given level. As an application, we introduce the notion of weak information on a complete market, and we give a {\textquotedblleft}quantitative{\textquotedblright} value to this weak information. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It covers a range of numerical schemes to compute the large deviation minimizer in various setups and discusses best practices, common pitfalls, and implementation tradeo s. Generalizations, extensions, and improvements of the minimum action methods are proposed. These algorithms are tested on example problems which illustrate several common di culties which arise, e.g., when the forcing is degenerate or multiplicative, or the systems are in nite-dimensional. Generalizations to processes driven by non-Gaussian noises or random initial data and parameters are also discussed, along with the connection between the LDT-based approach reviewed here and other methods, such as stochastic eld theory and optimal control. Finally, the integration of this approach in importance sampling methods using, e.g., genealogical algorithms, is explored.},

	abstract = {When a system has more than one stable state, how can the stability of these states be compared? This deceptively simple question has important consequences for ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo dramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of these shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states. Unfortunately, the concept of {\textquotedblleft}stability{\textquotedblright} in ecology has suffered from substantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where stochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable states. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a ball-in-cupdiagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the position of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push the ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by a potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. Systems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite rare, however. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other approaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear stability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and, as we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will behave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how the potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly, employing a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential. Using three classic ecological models, we demonstrate that the quasi-potential provides a useful way to quantify stability in stochastic systems. We show that the quasi-potential framework helps clarify long-standing confusion about stability in stochastic ecological systems, and we argue that ecologists should adopt it as a practical tool for analyzing these systems.},

Their success dates back to Feynman who showed how to use them within the framework of quantum mechanics. Since then, path integrals have pervaded all areas of physics where fluctuation effects, quantum and/or thermal, are of paramount importance. Their appeal is based on the fact that one converts a problem formulated in terms of operators into one of sampling classical paths with a given weight. Path integrals are the mirror image of our conventional Riemann integrals, with functions replacing the real numbers one usually sums over. However, unlike conventional integrals, path integration suffers a serious drawback: in general, one cannot make non-linear changes of variables without committing an error of some sort. Thus, no path-integral based calculus is possible. Here we identify which are the deep mathematical reasons causing this important caveat, and we come up with cures for systems described by one degree of freedom. Our main result is a construction of path integration free of this longstanding problem, through a direct time-discretization procedure.},

	abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein{\textquoteright}s theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

	abstract = {The design of analogue electronic experiments to investigate phenomena in nonlinear dynamics, especially stochastic phenomena, is described in practical terms. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach, in comparison to more conventional digital methods, are discussed. It is pointed out that analogue simulation provides a simple, inexpensive, technique that is easily applied in any laboratory to facilitate the design and implementation of complicated and expensive experimental projects; and that there are some important problems for which analogue methods have so far provided the only experimental approach. Applications to several topical problems are reviewed. Large rare fluctuations are studied through measurements of the prehistory probability distribution, thereby testing for the first time some fundamental tenets of fluctuation theory. It has thus been shown for example that, whereas the fluctuations of equilibrium systems obey time-reversal symmetry, those under non-equilibrium conditions are temporally asymmetric. Stochastic resonance, in which the signal-to-noise ratio for a weak periodic signal in a nonlinear system can be enhanced by added noise, has been widely studied by analogue methods, and the main results are reviewed; the closely related phenomena of noise-enhanced heterodyning and noiseinduced linearization are also described. Selected examples of the use of analogue methods for the study of transient phenomena in time-evolving systems are reviewed. Analogue experiments with quasimonochromatic noise, whose power spectral density is peaked at some characteristic frequency, have led to the discovery of a range of interesting and often counter-intuitive effects. These are reviewed and related to large fluctuation phenomena. Analogue studies of two examples of deterministic nonlinear effects, modulation-induced negative differential resistance (MINDR) and zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance (ZDNR) are described. Finally, some speculative remarks about possible future directions and applications of analogue experiments are discussed.},

The eigenvalues of the Fokker{\textendash}Planck operator provide information about the speed of convergence of the corresponding probability distribution to steady state, which is important for stochastic estimation and control applications.

First, we discuss a PT (parity-time) symmetry that appears in ensembles of trajectories where a current is constrained to have a large (non-typical) value. We analyse the heat flow in such ensembles, and compare it with non-equilibrium steady states. Second, we consider pathwise large deviations that are defined by considering many copies of a system. We show how the probability currents in such systems can be decomposed into orthogonal contributions that are related to convergence to equilibrium and to dissipation. We discuss the implications of these results for modelling non-equilibrium steady states.},

They are equivalent to minimizers of the related Freidlin{\textendash}Wentzell action and known to be able to characterize rare events in such systems. While there is an impressive body of work concerning their analytical description, this review focuses on the question on how to compute these minimizers numerically. In a short introduction we present the relevant mathematical and physical background before we discuss the stochastic Burgers equation in detail. We present algorithms to compute instantons numerically by an efficient solution of the corresponding Euler{\textendash}Lagrange equations. A second focus is the discussion of a recently developed numerical filtering technique that allows to extract instantons from direct numerical simulations. In the following we present modifications of the algorithms to make them efficient when applied to two- or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) fluid dynamical problems. We illustrate these ideas using the 2D Burgers equation and the 3D Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations.},

In this work, we show a consistent approach to solve conditional and unconditional Euclidean (Wiener) Gaussian path integrals that allow us to compute transition probabilities in the semi-classical approximation from the solutions of a system of linear differential equations. Our method is particularly useful for investigating Fokker-Planck dynamics, and the physics of string-like objects such as polymers. To give some examples, we derive the time evolution of the d-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and of the Van der Pol oscillator driven by white noise. Moreover, we compute the end-to-end transition probability for a charged string at thermal equilibrium, when an external field is applied.},

For experiments on a single colloidal particle in a microchannel, we extract both ratios of path probabilities, and the most probable path for a barrier crossing. While we find excellent agreement with independently calculated predictions based on the Onsager-Machlup stochastic action, our experimental results are inconsistent with the Freidlin-Wentzell stochastic action.

We show that this leads to an expression for the pathwise medium entropy production that is in agreement with the formal expression from stochastic thermodynamics and devise a procedure for its measurement as a difference of exit rates from tubes.

The approach is based on dynamical ensembles, determined by an action on trajectory space. (Anti)Symmetry under time-reversal separates two complementary contributions in the response, one entropic the other frenetic. Under time-reversal invariance of the unperturbed reference process, only the entropic term is present in the response, giving the standard fluctuation-dissipation relations in equilibrium. For nonequilibrium reference ensembles, the frenetic term contributes essentially and is responsible for new phenomena. We discuss modifications in the Sutherland-Einstein relation, the occurence of negative differential mobilities and the saturation of response. We also indicate how the Einstein relation between noise and friction gets violated for probes coupled to a nonequilibrium environment. We end with some discussion on the situation for quantum phenomena, but the bulk of the text concerns classical mesoscopic (open) systems. The choice of many simple examples is trying to make the notes pedagogical, to introduce an important area of research in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.},

	abstract = {The typical values and fluctuations of time-integrated observables of nonequilibrium processes driven in steady states are known to be characterized by large deviation functions, generalizing the entropy and free energy to nonequilibrium systems. The definition of these functions involves a scaling limit, similar to the thermodynamic limit, in which the integration time \${\textbackslash}tau\$ appears linearly, unless the process considered has long-range correlations, in which case \${\textbackslash}tau\$ is generally replaced by \${\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}xi\$ with \${\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}neq 1\$. Here we show that such an anomalous power-law scaling in time of large deviations can also arise without long-range correlations in Markovian processes as simple as the Langevin equation. We describe the mechanism underlying this scaling using path integrals and discuss its physical consequences for more general processes.},

	abstract = {The Onsager-Machlup (OM) functional is well known for characterizing the most probable transition path of a diffusion process with non-vanishing noise. However, it suffers from a notorious issue that the functional is unbounded below when the specified transition time T goes to infinity. This hinders the interpretation of the results obtained by minimizing the OM functional. We provide a new perspective on this issue. Under mild conditions, we show that although the infimum of the OM functional becomes unbounded when T goes to infinity, the sequence of minimizers does contain convergent subsequences on the space of curves. The graph limit of this minimizing subsequence is an extremal of the abbreviated action functional, which is related to the OM functional via the Maupertuis principle with an optimal energy. We further propose an energy-climbing geometric minimization algorithm (EGMA) which identifies the optimal energy and the graph limit of the transition path simultaneously. This algorithm is successfully applied to several typical examples in rare event studies. Some interesting comparisons with the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional are also made.},

We identify their origin and we show how to extend the well-known Ito prescription (dB2 = dt) in a way that defines a modified stochastic calculus to be used inside the pathintegral representation of the process, in its Onsager{\textendash}Machlup form.},

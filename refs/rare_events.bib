	abstract = {Rare weather and climate events, such as heat waves and floods, can bring tremendous social costs. Climate data is often limited in duration and spatial coverage, and climate forecasting has often turned to simulations of climate models to make better predictions of rare weather events. However very long simulations of complex models, in order to obtain accurate probability estimates, may be prohibitively slow. It is an important scientific problem to develop probabilistic and dynamical techniques to estimate the probabilities of rare events accurately from limited data. In this paper we compare four modern methods of estimating the probability of rare events: the generalized extreme value (GEV) method from classical extreme value theory; two importance sampling techniques, geneaological particle analysis (GPA) and the Giardina-Kurchan-Lecomte-Tailleur (GKLT) algorithm; as well as brute force Monte Carlo (MC). With these techniques we estimate the probabilities of rare events in three dynamical models: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the Lorenz {\textquoteright}96 system and PlaSim (a climate model). We keep the computational effort constant and see how well the rare event probability estimation of each technique compares to a gold standard afforded by a very long run control. Somewhat surprisingly we find that classical extreme value theory methods outperform GPA, GKLT and MC at estimating rare events.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12890},
	abstract = {Very often when studying non-equilibrium systems one is interested in analysing dynamical behaviour that occurs with very low probability, so called rare events. In practice, since rare events are by definition atypical, they are often difficult to access in a statistically significant way. What are required are strategies to {\textquotedblleft}make rare events typical{\textquotedblright} so that they can be generated on demand. Here we present such a general approach to adaptively construct a dynamics that efficiently samples atypical events. We do so by exploiting the methods of reinforcement learning (RL), which refers to the set of machine learning techniques aimed at finding the optimal behaviour to maximise a reward associated with the dynamics. We consider the general perspective of dynamical trajectory ensembles, whereby rare events are described in terms of ensemble reweighting. By minimising the distance between a reweighted ensemble and that of a suitably parametrised controlled dynamics we arrive at a set of methods similar to those of RL to numerically approximate the optimal dynamics that realises the rare behaviour of interest. As simple illustrations we consider in detail the problem of excursions of a random walker, for the case of rare events with a finite time horizon; and the problem of a studying current statistics of a particle hopping in a ring geometry, for the case of an infinite time horizon. We discuss natural extensions of the ideas presented here, including to continuous-time Markov systems, first passage time problems and non-Markovian dynamics.},

	abstract = {In the past 15 years transition path sampling (TPS) has evolved from its basic algorithm to an entire collection of methods and a framework for investigating rare events in complex systems. The methodology is applicable to a wide variety of systems and processes, ranging from transitions in small clusters or molecules to chemical reactions, phase transitions, and conformational changes in biomolecules. The basic idea of TPS is to harvest dynamical unbiased trajectories that connect a reactant with a product, by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure called shooting. This simple importance sampling yields the rate constants, the free energy surface, insight in the mechanism of the rare event of interest, and by using the concept of the committor, also access to the reaction coordinate. In the last decade extensions to TPS have been developed, notably the transition interface sampling (TIS) methods, and its generalization multiple state TIS. Combination with advanced sampling methods such as replica exchange and the Wang-Landau algorithm, among others, improves sampling efficiency. Notwithstanding the success of TPS, there are issues left to discuss, and, despite the method{\textquoteright}s apparent simplicity, many pitfalls to avoid. This paper discusses several of these issues and pitfalls: the choice of stable states and interface order parameters, the problem of positioning the TPS windows and TIS interfaces, the matter of convergence of the path ensemble, the matter of kinetic traps, and the question whether TPS is able to investigate and sample Markov state models. We also review the reweighting technique used to join path ensembles. Finally we discuss the use of the sampled path ensemble to obtain reaction coordinates.},

	abstract = {Rare events are processes that occur upon the emergence of unlikely fluctuations. Unlike what their name suggests, rare events are fairly ubiquitous in nature, as the occurrence of many structural transformations in biology and material sciences is predicated upon crossing large free energy barriers. Probing the kinetics and uncovering the molecular mechanisms of possible barrier crossings in a system is critical to predicting and controlling its structural and functional properties. Due to their activated nature, however, rare events are exceptionally difficult to study using conventional experimental and computational techniques. In recent decades, a wide variety of specialized computational techniques{\textemdash}known as advanced sampling techniques{\textemdash}have been developed to systematically capture improbable fluctuations relevant to rare events. In this perspective, we focus on a technique called forward flux sampling [Allen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 124, 024102 (2006)] and overview its recent methodological variants and extensions. We also provide a detailed overview of its application to study a wide variety of rare events and map out potential avenues for further explorations.},

To this end, we deploy the so-called instanton formalism that corresponds to a saddle-point approximation of the action in the path integral formulation of the underlying SPDE. The crucial step in our approach is the formulation of an alternative SPDE that incorporates knowledge of the instanton solution such that we are able to constrain the dynamical evolutions around extreme ow con gurations only. Finally, a reweighting procedure based on the Girsanov theorem is applied to recover the full distribution function of the original system. The entire procedure is demonstrated on the example of the one-dimensional Burgers equation. Furthermore, we compare our method to conventional direct numerical simulations as well as to Hybrid Monte Carlo methods. It will be shown that the instanton-based sampling method outperforms both approaches and allows for an accurate quanti cation of the whole probability density function of velocity gradients from the core to the very far tails.},

	abstract = {The ring-polymer instanton (RPI) method is an efficient technique for calculating approximate tunneling splittings in high-dimensional molecular systems. In the RPI method, tunneling splitting is evaluated from the properties of the minimum action path (MAP) connecting the symmetric wells, whereby the extensive sampling of the full potential energy surface of the exact quantum-dynamics methods is avoided. Nevertheless, the search for the MAP is usually the most time-consuming step in the standard numerical procedures. Recently, nudged elastic band (NEB) and string methods, originaly developed for locating minimum energy paths (MEPs), were adapted for the purpose of MAP finding with great efficiency gains [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 787]. In this work, we develop a new quadratic string method for locating instantons. The Euclidean action is minimized by propagating the initial guess (a path connecting two wells) over the quadratic potential energy surface approximated by means of updated Hessians. This allows the algorithm to take many minimization steps between the potential/gradient calls with further reductions in the computational effort, exploiting the smoothness of potential energy surface. The approach is general, as it uses Cartesian coordinates, and widely applicable, with computational effort of finding the instanton usually lower than that of determining the MEP. It can be combined with expensive potential energy surfaces or on-the-fly electronic-structure methods to explore a wide variety of molecular systems.},

Here it is argued that both actions are equivalent prescriptions for the purposes of reweighting and sampling trajectories, whereas the most probable path is more generally given by the global minimum of the action involving the second derivative term. The answer to this apparent paradox lies in the non-differentiable character of Brownian paths, as well as in the "entropy" associated with a given trajectory.},

  abstract = {The Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm provides a framework for sampling from complex, high-dimensional target distributions. In contrast with standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it generates nonlocal, nonsymmetric moves in the state space, alleviating random walk type behaviour for the simulated trajectories. However, similarly to algorithms based on random walk or Langevin proposals, the number of steps required to explore the target distribution typically grows with the dimension of the state space. We define a generalized HMC algorithm which overcomes this problem for target measures arising as finite-dimensional approximations of measures {$\pi$} which have density with respect to a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The key idea is to construct an MCMC method which is well defined on the Hilbert space itself. We successively address the following issues in the infinite-dimensional setting of a Hilbert space: (i) construction of a probability measure {$\Pi$} in an enlarged phase space having the target {$\pi$} as a marginal, together with a Hamiltonian flow that preserves {$\Pi$}; (ii) development of a suitable geometric numerical integrator for the Hamiltonian flow; and (iii) derivation of an accept/reject rule to ensure preservation of {$\Pi$} when using the above numerical integrator instead of the actual Hamiltonian flow. Experiments are reported that compare the new algorithm with standard HMC and with a version of the Langevin MCMC method defined on a Hilbert space.},

  abstract = {We present and study a Langevin MCMC approach for sampling nonlinear diffusion bridges. The method is based on recent theory concerning stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) reversible with respect to the target bridge, derived by applying the Langevin idea on the bridge pathspace. In the process, a Random-Walk Metropolis algorithm and an Independence Sampler are also obtained. The novel algorithmic idea of the paper is that proposed moves for the MCMC algorithm are determined by discretising the SPDEs in the time direction using an implicit scheme, parametrised by \texttheta{} {$\in$} [0,1]. We show that the resulting infinite-dimensional MCMC sampler is well-defined only if \texttheta{} = 1/2, when the MCMC proposals have the correct quadratic variation. Previous Langevin-based MCMC methods used explicit schemes, corresponding to \texttheta{} = 0. The significance of the choice \texttheta{} = 1/2 is inherited by the finite-dimensional approximation of the algorithm used in practice. We present numerical results illustrating the phenomenon and the theory that explains it. Diffusion bridges (with additive noise) are representative of the family of laws defined as a change of measure from Gaussian distributions on arbitrary separable Hilbert spaces; the analysis in this paper can be readily extended to target laws from this family and an example from signal processing illustrates this fact.},

The theory is illustrated with applications to protein folding and the dipole reorientation of an ordered water chain inside a carbon nanotube. To describe the folding of a simple model of a three-helix bundle protein, we variationally optimize the weights of a projection onto the matrix of native and nonnative amino acid contacts. The resulting one-dimensional reaction coordinate captures the folding transition state, with formation and packing of helix 2 and 3 constituting the bottleneck for folding.},

  abstract = {The development of enhanced sampling methods to investigate rare but important events has always been a focal point in the molecular simulation field. Such methods often rely on prior knowledge of the reaction coordinate. However, the search for this reaction coordinate is at the heart of the rare event problem. Transition path sampling (TPS) circumvents this problem by generating an ensemble of dynamical trajectories undergoing the activated event. The reaction coordinate is extracted from the resulting path ensemble using variants of machine learning, making it an output of the method instead of an input. Over the last 20 years, since its inception, many extensions of TPS have been developed. Perhaps surprisingly, large-scale TPS simulations on complex molecular systems have become possible only recently. Other important developments include the transition interface sampling (TIS) methodology to compute rate constants, the application to multiple states, and adaptive path sampling. The development of OpenPathSampling and PyRETIS has enabled easy and flexible use and implementation of these and other novel path sampling algorithms. In this progress report, a brief overview of recent developments, novel algorithms, and software is given. In addition, several application areas are discussed, and a future outlook for the next decade is given.},

  abstract = {Path integrals play a crucial role in describing the dynamics of physical systems subject to classical or quantum noise. In fact, when correctly normalized, they express the probability of transition between two states of the system. In this work, we show a consistent approach to solve conditional and unconditional Euclidean (Wiener) Gaussian path integrals that allow us to compute transition probabilities in the semiclassical approximation from the solutions of a system of linear differential equations. Our method is particularly useful for investigating Fokker-Planck dynamics and the physics of stringlike objects such as polymers. To give some examples, we derive the time evolution of the d-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and of the Van der Pol oscillator driven by white noise. Moreover, we compute the end-to-end transition probability for a charged string at thermal equilibrium, when an external field is applied.},

  abstract = {Many problems arising in applications result in the need to probe a probability distribution for functions. Examples include Bayesian nonparametric statistics and conditioned diffusion processes. Standard MCMC algorithms typically become arbitrarily slow under the mesh refinement dictated by nonparametric description of the unknown function. We describe an approach to modifying a whole range of MCMC methods, applicable whenever the target measure has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, which ensures that their speed of convergence is robust under mesh refinement. Gaussian processes or random fields are fields whose marginal distributions, when evaluated at any finite set of \$N\$ points, are \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{N\}\$-valued Gaussians. The algorithmic approach that we describe is applicable not only when the desired probability measure has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, but also to some useful non-Gaussian reference measures constructed through random truncation. In the applications of interest the data is often sparse and the prior specification is an essential part of the overall modelling strategy. These Gaussian-based reference measures are a very flexible modelling tool, finding wide-ranging application. Examples are shown in density estimation, data assimilation in fluid mechanics, subsurface geophysics and image registration. The key design principle is to formulate the MCMC method so that it is, in principle, applicable for functions; this may be achieved by use of proposals based on carefully chosen time-discretizations of stochastic dynamical systems which exactly preserve the Gaussian reference measure. Taking this approach leads to many new algorithms which can be implemented via minor modification of existing algorithms, yet which show enormous speed-up on a wide range of applied problems.},

This work introduces a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers that can adapt to the particular structure of a posterior distribution over functions. Two distinct lines of research intersect in the methods developed here. First, we introduce a general class of operator-weighted proposal distributions that are well defined on function space, such that the performance of the resulting MCMC samplers is independent of the discretization of the function. Second, by exploiting local Hessian information and any associated low-dimensional structure in the change from prior to posterior distributions, we develop an inhomogeneous discretization scheme for the Langevin stochastic differential equation that yields operator-weighted proposals adapted to the non-Gaussian structure of the posterior. The resulting dimension-independent and likelihood-informed (DILI) MCMC samplers may be useful for a large class of high-dimensional problems where the target probability measure has a density with respect to a Gaussian reference measure. Two nonlinear inverse problems are used to demonstrate the efficiency of these DILI samplers: an elliptic PDE coefficient inverse problem and path reconstruction in a conditioned diffusion.},

It characterizes the difficulty of the escape from the neighborhood of an attractor of a stochastic non-gradient dynamical system due to the influence of small white noise. It also gives an estimate of the invariant probability distribution in the neighborhood of the attractor up to the exponential order. We present a new family of methods for computing the quasi-potential on a regular mesh named the ordered line integral methods (OLIMs). In comparison with the first proposed quasi-potential finder based on the ordered upwind method (OUM) (Cameron in Phys D Nonlinear Phenom 241:1532\textendash 1550, 2012), the new methods are 1.5\textendash 4 times faster, can produce error two to three orders of magnitude smaller, and may exhibit faster convergence. Similar to the OUM, OLIMs employ the dynamical programming principle. Contrary to it, they (1) have an optimized strategy for the use of computationally expensive triangle updates leading to a notable speed-up, and (2) directly solve local minimization problems using quadrature rules instead of solving the corresponding Hamilton\textendash Jacobi-type equation by the first order finite difference upwind scheme. The OLIM with the right-hand quadrature rule is equivalent to OUM. The use of higher order quadrature rules in local minimization problems dramatically boosts up the accuracy of OLIMs. We offer a detailed discussion on the origin of numerical errors in OLIMs and propose rules-of-thumb for the choice of the important parameter, the update factor, in the OUM and OLIMs. Our results are supported by extensive numerical tests on two challenging 2D examples.},

Here, we present a simulation method for evaluating the rate and mechanism of rare events in generic nonequilibrium systems and apply it to study the conformational changes of a passive solute in an active fluid. The method employs a variational optimization of a control force that renders the rare event a typical one, supplying an exact estimate of its rate as a ratio of path partition functions. Using this method we find that increasing activity in the active bath can enhance the rate of conformational switching of the passive solute in a manner consistent with recent bounds from stochastic thermodynamics.},

The underlying concepts are closely related to techniques of merging families of Lyapunov functions in hybrid system analysis. It is hoped that these techniques will add to the set of tools available for predicting and preventing cascading failure in large scale networks.},

However, it suffers from a notorious issue that the functional is unbounded below when the specified transition time T goes to infinity. This hinders the interpretation of the results obtained by minimizing the OM functional. We provide a new perspective on this issue. Under mild conditions, we show that although the infimum of the OM functional becomes unbounded when T goes to infinity, the sequence of minimizers does contain convergent subsequences on the space of curves. The graph limit of this minimizing subsequence is an extremal of the abbreviated action functional, which is related to the OM functional via the Maupertuis principle with an optimal energy. We further propose an energy-climbing geometric minimization algorithm (EGMA) which identifies the optimal energy and the graph limit of the transition path simultaneously. This algorithm is successfully applied to several typical examples in rare event studies. Some interesting comparisons with the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional are also made.},

Our first analysis of the optimization problem is in the setting of a double well model, and it shows that the optimal selection of temperature ratios is a geometric sequence except possibly the highest temperature. In the same setting we identify two different sources of variance reduction, and show how their competition determines the optimal highest temperature. In the general multi-well setting we prove that a pure geometric sequence of temperature ratios is always nearly optimal, with a performance gap that decays geometrically in the number of temperatures.},

To this end, we deploy the so-called instanton formalism that corresponds to a saddle-point approximation of the action in the path integral formulation of the underlying SPDE. The crucial step in our approach is the formulation of an alternative SPDE that incorporates knowledge of the instanton solution such that we are able to constrain the dynamical evolutions around extreme flow configurations only. Finally, a reweighting procedure based on the Girsanov theorem is applied to recover the full distribution function of the original system. The entire procedure is demonstrated on the example of the one-dimensional Burgers equation. Furthermore, we compare our method to conventional direct numerical simulations as well as to Hybrid Monte Carlo methods. It will be shown that the instanton-based sampling method outperforms both approaches and allows for an accurate quantification of the whole probability density function of velocity gradients from the core to the very far tails.},

The action is discretized and a preconditioned BFGS method is used to optimize the discrete action. Applications are presented for thermally activated reversal in the Ginzburg-Landau model in one and two dimensions, and for noise-induced excursion events in the Brusselator taken as an example of a nongradient system arising in chemistry. In the Ginzburg-Landau model, the reversal proceeds via interesting nucleation events, followed by propagation of domain walls. The issue of nucleation versus propagation is discussed, and the scaling for the number of nucleation events as a function of the reversal time and other material parameters is computed. Good agreement is found with the numerical results. In the Brusselator, whose deterministic dynamics has a single stable equilibrium state, the presence of noise is shown to induce large excursions by which the system cycles out of this equilibrium state.}

This work offers a rigorous and detailed introduction to the foundations of this theory, up to and including such advanced topics as orbital-dependent functionals as well as both time-dependent and relativistic DFT. Given the many ramifications of contemporary DFT, the text concentrates on the self-contained presentation of the basics of the most widely used DFT variants: this implies a thorough discussion of the corresponding existence theorems and effective single particle equations, as well as of key approximations utilized in implementations. The formal results are complemented by selected quantitative results, which primarily aim at illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of particular approaches or functionals. The structure and content of this book allow a tutorial and modular self-study approach: the reader will find that all concepts of many-body theory which are indispensable for the discussion of DFT - such as the single-particle Green's function or response functions - are introduced step by step, along with the actual DFT material. The same applies to basic notions of solid state theory, such as the Fermi surface of inhomogeneous, interacting systems. In fact, even the language of second quantization is introduced systematically in an Appendix for readers without formal training in many-body theory.},

In this review, a broad account of transition path sampling approaches is provided, starting from the general concepts, progressing to the specific principles that underlie some of the most important methods, and eventually singling out the so-called forward flux sampling method for a more detailed description. This is done because forward flux sampling, despite its appealing simplicity and potential efficiency, has thus far received limited attention from practitioners. While path sampling methods have a widespread application to many types of rare transitional events, here only recent applications involving biomolecules are reviewed, including isomerization, protein folding, and enzyme catalysis.},

The method is applied to the folding of the Villin Headpiece Subdomain, in the framework of a Go-model. We have found that, in this model, the transition occurs through an initial collapsing phase driven by the starting coil configuration and a later rearrangement phase, in which secondary structures are formed and all computed paths display strong similarities. This method is completely general, does not require the prior knowledge of any reaction coordinate and represents an efficient tool to perfom ab-initio simulations of the entire folding process with available computers.},

This paper presents a robust and efficient algorithm for reconstructing random media, which can then be fed into stochastic finite element solvers for statistical response analysis. The new method is based on nonlinear transformation of Gaussian random fields, and the reconstructed media can meet the discrete-valued marginal probability distribution function and the two-point correlation function of the reference medium. The new method, which avoids iterative root-finding computation, is highly efficient and particularly suitable for reconstructing large-size random media or a large number of samples. Also, benefiting from the high efficiency of the proposed reconstruction scheme, a Karhunen\textendash Lo\`eve (KL) representation of the target random medium can be efficiently estimated by projecting the reconstructed samples onto the KL basis. The resulting uncorrelated KL coefficients can be further expressed as functions of independent Gaussian random variables to obtain an approximate Gaussian representation, which is often required in stochastic finite element analysis.

  abstract = {The computation of free energies is a common issue in statistical physics. A natural technique to compute such high dimensional integrals is to resort to Monte Carlo simulations. However these techniques generally suffer from a high variance in the low temperature regime, because the expectation is often dominated by high values corresponding to rare system trajectories. A standard way to reduce the variance of the estimator is to modify the drift of the dynamics with a control enhancing the probability of rare event, leading to so-called importance sampling estimators. In theory, the optimal control leads to a zero-variance estimator; it is however defined implicitly and computing it is of the same difficulty as the original problem. We propose here a general strategy to build approximate optimal controls in the small temperature limit for diffusion processes, with the first goal to reduce the variance of free energy Monte Carlo estimators. Our construction builds upon low noise asymptotics by expanding the optimal control around the instanton, which is the path describing most likely fluctuations at low temperature. This technique not only helps reducing variance, but it is also interesting as a theoretical tool since it differs from usual small temperature expansions (WKB ansatz). As a complementary consequence of our expansion, we provide a perturbative formula for computing the free energy in the small temperature regime, which refines the now standard Freidlin--Wentzell asymptotics. We compute this expansion explicitly for lower orders, and explain how our strategy can be extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy. We support our findings with illustrative numerical examples.},

Chem. Phys. 133, 224105 (2010) https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3510519.]. The basic idea of this method is that the system we want to study (for example, some molecular system described by molecular mechanics) is coupled to a coarse-grained (CG) system, which can move more quickly and can be computed more efficiently than the original system. We simulate this combined system (original + CG system) using Langevin dynamics where different heat baths are coupled to the two systems. When the coupling is strong enough, the original system is guided by the CG system, and is able to sample the configuration and path space with more efficiency. We need to correct the bias caused by the coupling, however, by employing the Hamiltonian replica exchange, where we prepare many path replicas with different coupling strengths. As a result, an unbiased path ensemble for the original system can be found in the weakest coupling path ensemble. This strategy is easily implemented because a weight for a path calculated by the OM action is formally the same as the Boltzmann weight if we properly define the path ``Hamiltonian.'' We apply this method to a model polymer with Asakura-Oosawa interaction, and compare the results with the conventional transition path sampling method.},

The first week was focused on quantum and classical systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom; the second week on field theories. During the first week the basic course, given by P. Cartier, was a presentation of a recent rigorous approach to functional integration which does not resort to discretization, nor to analytic continuation. It provides a definition of functional integrals simpler and more powerful than the original ones. Could this approach accommodate the works presented by the other lecturers? Although much remains to be done before answering "Yes," there seems to be no major obstacle along the road. The other courses taught during the first week presented: a) a solid introduction to functional numerical techniques (A. Sokal) and their applications to functional integrals encountered in chemistry (N. Makri). b) integrals based on Poisson processes and their applications to wave propagation (S. K. Foong), in particular a wave-restorer or wave-designer algorithm yielding the initial wave profile when one can only observe its distortion through a dissipative medium. c) the formulation of a quantum equivalence principle (H.

Chapter 7 considers the application of variational methods to the study of systems with infinite degrees of freedom, and Chapter 8 deals with direct methods in the calculus of variations. The problems following each chapter were made specially for this English-language edition, and many of them comment further on corresponding parts of the text. Two appendices and suggestions for supplementary reading round out the text.Substantially revised and corrected by the translator, this inexpensive new edition will be welcomed by advanced undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics and physics.},

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to \$\textbackslash infty\$. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

  abstract = {Summary. The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis\textendash Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

We provide the missing link between theory and experiment by establishing a protocol to extract ratios of path probabilities from measured time series. For experiments on a single colloidal particle in a microchannel, we extract both ratios of path probabilities and the most probable path for a barrier crossing, and find excellent agreement with independently calculated predictions based on the Onsager-Machlup stochastic action. Our experimental results at room temperature are found to be inconsistent with the low-noise Freidlin-Wentzell stochastic action, and we discuss under which circumstances the latter action is expected to describe the most probable path. Furthermore, while the experimentally accessible ratio of path probabilities is uniquely determined, the formal path-integral action is known to depend on the time-discretization scheme used for deriving it; we reconcile these two seemingly contradictory facts by careful analysis of the time-slicing derivation of the path integral. Our experimental protocol enables us to probe probability distributions on path space and allows us to relate theoretical single-trajectory results to measurement.},

The approach gives exponential estimates that often need to be refined via calculation of a prefactor. Here it is shown how to perform these computations in practice. Specifically, sharp asymptotic estimates are derived for expectations, probabilities, and mean first passage times in a form that is geared towards numerical purposes: they require solving well-posed matrix Riccati equations involving the minimizer of the Freidlin-Wentzell action as input, either forward or backward in time with appropriate initial or final conditions tailored to the estimate at hand.

  abstract = {IntroductionThe two most prominent branches of macroscopic physics, reversible classical mechanics and reversible equilibrium thermodynamics, are both characterized by extremum principles \textendash{} the principle of stationary action for a classical trajectory, and the principle of maximum entropy for thermodynamic equilibrium in a closed system. It is well known how both of these extremum principles arise by taking the macroscopic limit of more fundamental underlying microscopic theories, in which these extremum principles do not hold: quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, respectively. In these microscopic theories the extremum principles are violated by the occurrence of fluctuations; quantum fluctuations by which finite probability amplitudes are assigned to nonclassical trajectories, and classical fluctuations which assign nonzero probabilities to states with less than the maximum entropy. Hence, there is a deep connection in physics between fluctuation phenomena and extremum principles, the former providing a mechanism allowing the system to explore a neighbourhood of the extremizing state and thereby to identify the extremum.The last decade has seen a considerable increase of interest in non-equilibrium phenomena in macroscopic systems, as it was realized that simple and rather general mechanisms of self-organization exist in such systems (cf., e.g. Haken, 1977, 1983; Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977), leading to the selection, formation and competition of patterns in space and (or) time. The evolution equations governing these nonequilibrium phenomena neither belong to the realm of equilibrium thermodynamics, therefore thermodynamic extremum principles are not applicable, nor to the realm of reversible classical mechanics covered by the principle of least action.},

The SPDE may be viewed as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Langevin equation used in finite-dimensional sampling. In this paper, conditioned nonlinear SDEs, leading to nonlinear SPDEs for the sampling, are studied. In addition, a class of preconditioned SPDEs is studied, found by applying a Green's operator to the SPDE in such a way that the invariant measure remains unchanged; such infinite dimensional evolution equations are important for the development of practical algorithms for sampling infinite dimensional problems. The resulting SPDEs provide several significant challenges in the theory of SPDEs. The two primary ones are the presence of nonlinear boundary conditions, involving first order derivatives, and a loss of the smoothing property in the case of the pre-conditioned SPDEs. These challenges are overcome and a theory of existence, uniqueness and ergodicity is developed in sufficient generality to subsume the sampling problems of interest to us. The Gaussian theory developed in Part I of this paper considers Gaussian SDEs, leading to linear Gaussian SPDEs for sampling. This Gaussian theory is used as the basis for deriving nonlinear SPDEs which affect the desired sampling in the nonlinear case, via a change of measure.},

We consider the Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithm that adds an accept\textendash reject mechanism to a Markov chain proposal in order to make the chain reversible with respect to the target measure. We focus on cases where the proposal is either a Gaussian random walk (RWM) with covariance equal to that of the reference measure or an Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck proposal (pCN) for which the reference measure is invariant. Previous results in terms of scaling and diffusion limits suggested that the pCN has a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension while the RWM method has undesirable dimension-dependent behaviour. We confirm this claim by exhibiting a dimension-independent Wasserstein spectral gap for pCN algorithm for a large class of target measures. In our setting this Wasserstein spectral gap implies an \$L\^\{2\}\$-spectral gap. We use both spectral gaps to show that the ergodic average satisfies a strong law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and nonasymptotic bounds on the mean square error, all dimension independent. In contrast we show that the spectral gap of the RWM algorithm applied to the reference measures degenerates as the dimension tends to infinity.},

  abstract = {Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations for the description of the effect of small random perturbations on dynamical systems is exploited as a numerical tool. Specifically, a numerical algorithm is proposed to compute the quasi-potential in the theory, which is the key object to quantify the dynamics on long time scales when the effect of the noise becomes ubiquitous: the equilibrium distribution of the system, the pathways of transition between metastable states and their rate, etc., can all be expressed in terms of the quasi-potential. We propose an algorithm to compute these quantities called the geometric minimum action method (gMAM), which is a blend of the original minimum action method (MAM) and the string method. It is based on a reformulation of the large deviations action functional on the space of curves that allows one to easily perform the double minimization of the original action required to compute the quasi-potential. The theoretical background of the gMAM in the context of large deviations theory is discussed in detail, as well as the algorithmic aspects of the method. The gMAM is then illustrated on several examples: a finite-dimensional system displaying bistability and modeled by a nongradient stochastic ordinary differential equation, an infinite-dimensional analogue of this system modeled by a stochastic partial differential equation, and an example of a bistable genetic switch modeled by a Markov jump process. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {We analyse MCMC chains focusing on how to find simulation parameters that give good mixing for discrete time, Harris ergodic Markov chains on a general state space X having invariant distribution {$\pi$}. The analysis uses an upper bound for the variance of the probability estimate. For each simulation parameter set, the bound is estimated from an MCMC chain using recurrence intervals. Recurrence intervals are a generalization of recurrence periods for discrete Markov chains. It is easy to compare the mixing properties for different simulation parameters. The paper gives general advice on how to improve the mixing of the MCMC chains and a new methodology for how to find an optimal acceptance rate for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Several examples, both toy examples and large complex ones, illustrate how to apply the methodology in practice. We find that the optimal acceptance rate is smaller than the general recommendation in the literature in some of these examples.},

However, such simple 1:1 mapping must now give place to the modern concepts of gene regulatory networks and gene expression noise. Both can, in the absence of genetic mutations, jointly generate a diversity of inheritable randomly occupied phenotypic states that could also serve as a substrate for natural selection. This form of epigenetic dynamics challenges Neo-Darwinism. It needs to incorporate the non-linear, stochastic dynamics of gene networks. A first step is to consider the mathematical correspondence between gene regulatory networks and Waddington's metaphoric 'epigenetic landscape', which actually represents the quasi-potential function of global network dynamics. It explains the coexistence of multiple stable phenotypes within one genotype. The landscape's topography with its attractors is shaped by evolution through mutational re-wiring of regulatory interactions - offering a link between genetic mutation and sudden, broad evolutionary changes.},

Unlike what their name suggests, rare events are fairly ubiquitous in nature, as the occurrence of many structural transformations in biology and material sciences is predicated upon crossing large free energy barriers. Probing the kinetics and uncovering the molecular mechanisms of possible barrier crossings in a system is critical to predicting and controlling its structural and functional properties. Due to their activated nature, however, rare events are exceptionally difficult to study using conventional experimental and computational techniques. In recent decades, a wide variety of specialized computational techniques\textemdash known as advanced sampling techniques\textemdash have been developed to systematically capture improbable fluctuations relevant to rare events. In this perspective, we focus on a technique called forward flux sampling [Allen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 124, 024102 (2006)] and overview its recent methodological variants and extensions. We also provide a detailed overview of its application to study a wide variety of rare events and map out potential avenues for further explorations.},

The most probable path between two states (the instanton) and the leading term in the logarithm of the process transition density (the quasipotential) are obtained from the minimum of the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional. Here we present a Ritz method that searches for the minimum in a space of paths constructed from a global basis of Chebyshev polynomials. The action is reduced, thereby, to a multivariate function of the basis coefficients, whose minimum can be found by nonlinear optimization. For minimization regardless of path duration, this procedure is most effective when applied to a reparametrization-invariant ``on-shell'' action, which is obtained by exploiting a Noether symmetry and is a generalization of the scalar work [Olender and Elber, J. Mol. Struct: THEOCHEM 398, 63 (1997)] for gradient dynamics and the geometric action [Heyman and Vanden-Eijnden (2008)] for nongradient dynamics. Our approach provides an alternative to chain-of-states methods for minimum energy paths and saddle points of complex energy landscapes and to Hamilton-Jacobi methods for the stationary quasipotential of circulatory fields. We demonstrate spectral convergence for three benchmark problems involving the M\"uller-Brown potential, the Maier-Stein force field, and the Egger weather model.},

This activity has been as strong in the engineering and physical sciences as it has in mathematics, resulting inevitably in some duplication of effort due to an unfamiliarity with the developments in other disciplines. Much of the reported work has been motivated by the need to solve particular types of problems, for which, even more so than in the deterministic context, specific methods are required. The treatment has often been heuristic and ad hoc in character. Nevertheless, there are underlying principles present in many of the papers, an understanding of which will enable one to develop or apply appropriate numerical schemes for particular problems or classes of problems.},

Under quite general conditions, it can be shown that the posterior is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior and it may be well-defined on function space in terms of its density with respect to the prior. In this case, by constructing a proposal for which the prior is invariant, one can define Metropolis\textendash Hastings schemes for MCMC which are well-defined on function space (Stuart (2010) [1], Cotter et~al.~ [2]), and hence do not degenerate as the dimension of the underlying quantity of interest increases to infinity, e.g. under mesh refinement when approximating PDE in finite dimensions. However, in practice, despite the attractive theoretical properties of the currently available schemes, they may still suffer from long correlation times, particularly if the data is very informative about some of the unknown parameters. In fact, in this case it may be the directions of the posterior which coincide with the (already known) prior which decorrelate the slowest. The information incorporated into the posterior through the data is often contained within some finite-dimensional subspace, in an appropriate basis, perhaps even one defined by eigenfunctions of the prior. We aim to exploit this fact and improve the mixing time of function-space MCMC by careful rescaling of the proposal. To this end, we introduce two new basic methods of increasing complexity, involving (i) characteristic function truncation of high frequencies and (ii) Hessian information to interpolate between low and high frequencies. The second, more sophisticated version, bears some similarities with recent methods which exploit local curvature information, for example RMHMC, Girolami and Calderhead (2011) [3], and stochastic Newton, Martin et~al. (2012)~ [4]. These ideas are illustrated with numerical experiments on the Bayesian inversion of the heat equation and Navier\textendash Stokes equation, given noisy observations.},

The fact that the optimal transition path in this case is infinitely long imposes a severe numerical challenge to resolve it in the minimum action method. We first consider the landscape of the quasi-potential near the limit cycle, which characterizes the minimal cost of the noise to drive the system far away form the limit cycle. We derive and compute the quadratic approximation of this quasi-potential near the limit cycle in the form of a positive definite solution to a matrix-valued periodic Riccati differential equation on the limit cycle. We then combine this local approximation in the neighborhood of the limit cycle with the minimum action method applied outside of the neighborhood. The neighborhood size is selected to be compatible with the path discretization error. By several numerical examples, we show that this strategy effectively improves the minimum action method to compute the spiral optimal escape path from limit cycles in various systems.},

The main additions consist of a section on convergence of probabilities on metric spaces and a chapter whose first section on domains of attrac\- tion completes the study of the Central limit problem, while the second one is devoted to random walks.

In the method neural networks are used to determine the functional dependence of the probability of committing to a stable state (committor) on a set of coordinates, and a genetic algorithm selects the combination of inputs that yields the best fit. The method enables us to obtain the first set of coordinates that is demonstrably sufficient to specify the transition state of the C(7eq)--{$>$} alpha(R) isomerization of the alanine dipeptide in the presence of explicit water molecules. It is revealed that the solute-solvent coupling can be described by a solvent-derived electrostatic torque around one of the main-chain bonds, and the collective, long-ranged nature of this interaction accounts for previous failures to characterize this reaction.},

We explore the continuous-time limit where the OM functional has been commonly regularized by using the Ito-Girsanov change of measure. When used as a path measure, the Ito-Girsanov expression generates an ensemble of doubleended paths that are unphysical. We expose the underlying reasons why this continuous-time limit does not, and cannot, generate a thermodynamic ensemble of paths. Furthermore, we show that the concept of the Most Probable Path and the Thermodynamic action are incompatible with such measures for discrete or continuous time diffusion processes.},

When two species compete, and the population dynamics have multiple equilibria, a barrier crossing corresponds to fluctuations driving the populations across a deterministic separatrix. Similarly, fluctuation may drive quantitative traits across valleys in the surface of individual fitness, particularly when the fluctuations interact with a deterministic force such as a correlated selection reponse. In this paper, I show how to formulate and solve the barrier crossing problem. Two classes of models are considered. In models based on stochastic differential or difference equations, fluctuations are superimposed upon a system of deterministic differential or difference equations. In the case of a Markov chain, there may be no underlying deterministic system, so that the system is only characterized by Markovian transition probabilities. The validity of the diffusion approximation and the origin of macroscopic population dynamics from a underlying purely probabilistic system are investigated.},

First, we validate and benchmark the HMC algorithm by reproducing multiscale properties of the one-dimensional Burgers equation driven by Gaussian and white-in-time noise. Second, we show how to implement an importance sampling protocol to significantly enhance, by orders of magnitudes, the probability to sample extreme and rare events, making it possible to estimate moments of field variables of extremely high order (up to 30 and more). By employing reweighting techniques, we map the biased configurations back to the original probability measure in order to probe their statistical importance. Finally, we show that by biasing the system towards very intense negative gradients, the HMC algorithm is able to explore the statistical fluctuations around instanton configurations. Our results will also be interesting and relevant in lattice gauge theory since they provide unique insights into reweighting techniques.},

To localize an inverse problem is to enforce an anticipated ``local'' structure by (i ) neglecting small off-diagonal elements of the prior precision and covariance matrices; and (ii ) restricting the influence of observations to their neighborhood. For linear problems we can specify the conditions under which posterior moments of the localized problem are close to those of the original problem. We explain physical interpretations of our assumptions about local structure and discuss the notion of high dimensionality in local problems, which is different from the usual notion of high dimensionality in function space MCMC. The Gibbs sampler is a natural choice of MCMC algorithm for localized inverse problems and we demonstrate that its convergence rate is independent of dimension for localized linear problems. Nonlinear problems can also be tackled efficiently by localization and, as a simple illustration of these ideas, we present a localized Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler. Several linear and nonlinear numerical examples illustrate localization in the context of MCMC samplers for inverse problems.},

While theory suggests that many independent Markov chains may be run and their samples pooled, the well-known practical problem of quasi-ergodicity, or poor mixing, frustrates this otherwise simple approach. Furthermore, without some mechanism for hastening the convergence of individual chains, overall speedup from parallelism is limited by the portion of each chain to be discarded as burn-in. Existing multiple-chain methods, such as parallel tempering and population MCMC, use a synchronous exchange of samples to expedite convergence. This work instead proposes mixing in an additional independent proposal, representing some hitherto best estimate or summary of the posterior, and cooperatively adapting this across chains. Such adaptation can be asynchronous, increases the ensemble's robustness to quasi-ergodic behaviour in constituent chains, and may improve overall tolerance to fault.},

We begin by defining the notion of a functional and its role in performing calculus on variations of curves. In order to identify those functions which are extremals of a functional, we establish the first variation and the Euler-Lagrange Equations. A formulation of the second variation follows, providing a means of identifying different types of extremals. Both the first and second variations are illustrated using several examples. We then introduce the calculus of variations as it applies to classical mechanics, resulting in the Principle of Stationary Action, from which we develop the foundations of Lagrangian mechanics. Finally, we examine an extension of the calculus of variations in optimal control. We conclude with Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and its applications in control theory.},

The Gaussian prefactor gives a correction to the low-noise approximation and leads us to define an instanton variance giving some insights as to how anomalous large deviations are created in time. The results are compared with simulations based on importance sampling, extending our previous results based on direct Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude by explaining why many of the standard analytical and numerical methods of large deviation theory fail in the case of anomalous large deviations.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic models are conceptually powerful tools for finding structure in data, but their practical effectiveness is often limited by our ability to perform inference in them. Exact inference is frequently intractable, so approximate inference is often performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To achieve the best possible results from MCMC, we want to efficiently simulate many steps of a rapidly mixing Markov chain which leaves the target distribution invariant. Of particular interest in this regard is how to take advantage of multi-core computing to speed up MCMC-based inference, both to improve mixing and to distribute the computational load. In this paper, we present a parallelizable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for efficiently sampling from continuous probability distributions that can take advantage of hundreds of cores. This method shares information between parallel Markov chains to build a scale-mixture of Gaussians approximation to the density function of the target distribution. We combine this approximation with a recent method known as elliptical slice sampling to create a Markov chain with no step-size parameters that can mix rapidly without requiring gradient or curvature computations.},

  abstract = {When a system has more than one stable state, how can the stability of these states be compared? This deceptively simple question has important consequences for ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo dramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of these shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states. Unfortunately, the concept of ``stability'' in ecology has suffered from substantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where stochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable states. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a ball-in-cup-diagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the position of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push the ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by a potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. Systems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite rare, however. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other approaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear stability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and, as we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will behave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how the potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly, employing a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential. Using three classic ecological models, we demonstrate that the quasi-potential provides a useful way to quantify stability in stochastic systems. We show that the quasi-potential framework helps clarify long-standing confusion about stability in stochastic ecological systems, and we argue that ecologists should adopt it as a practical tool for analyzing these systems.},

This optimal voltage path satisfies a second-order ordinary differential (Euler-Lagrange) equation which may be solved analytically in a number of special cases, and which may be solved numerically in general via a simple "shooting" algorithm. Our results are applicable for both linear and nonlinear subthreshold dynamics, and in certain cases may be extended to correlated subthreshold noise sources. We also show how this optimal voltage may be used to obtain approximations to (1) the likelihood that an IF cell with a given set of parameters was responsible for the observed spike train; and (2) the instantaneous firing rate and interspike interval distribution of a given noisy IF cell. The latter probability approximations are based on the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations principles for stochastic differential equations. We close by comparing this most likely voltage path to the true observed subthreshold voltage trace in a case when intracellular voltage recordings are available in vitro.},

The book contains a large number of illustrations, examples, and exercises.

  abstract = {To sample from complex, high-dimensional distributions, one may choose algorithms based on the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method. HMC-based algorithms generate nonlocal moves alleviating diffusive behavior. Here, I build on an already defined HMC framework, hybrid Monte Carlo on Hilbert spaces (Beskos, et al. Stoch. Proc. Applic. 2011), that provides finite-dimensional approximations of measures {$\pi$}, which have density with respect to a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert (path) space. In all HMC algorithms, one has some freedom to choose the mass operator. The novel feature of the algorithm described in this article lies in the choice of this operator. This new choice defines a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that is well defined on the Hilbert space itself. As before, the algorithm described herein uses an enlarged phase space {$\Pi$} having the target {$\pi$} as a marginal, together with a Hamiltonian flow that preserves {$\Pi$}. In the previous work, the authors explored a method where the phase space {$\pi$} was augmented with Brownian bridges. With this new choice, {$\pi$} is augmented by Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck (OU) bridges. The covariance of Brownian bridges grows with its length, which has negative effects on the acceptance rate in the MCMC method. This contrasts with the covariance of OU bridges, which is independent of the path length. The ingredients of the new algorithm include the definition of the mass operator, the equations for the Hamiltonian flow, the (approximate) numerical integration of the evolution equations, and finally, the Metropolis\textendash Hastings acceptance rule. Taken together, these constitute a robust method for sampling the target distribution in an almost dimension-free manner. The behavior of this novel algorithm is demonstrated by computer experiments for a particle moving in two dimensions, between two free-energy basins separated by an entropic barrier.},

An analog for finite temperature transitions is given by the Onsager\textendash Machlup functional. The purpose of this work is to investigate properties of Onsager\textendash Machlup minimizers. We study transition paths for thermally activated molecules governed by the Langevin equation in the overdamped limit of Brownian dynamics. Using gradient descent in pathspace, we minimize the Onsager\textendash Machlup functional for a range of model problems in one and two dimensions and then for some simple atomic models including Lennard-Jones seven-atom and 38-atom clusters, as well as for a model of vacancy diffusion in a planar crystal. Our results demonstrate interesting effects, which can occur at nonzero temperature, showing transition paths that could not be predicted on the basis of the zero temperature limit. However the results also demonstrate unphysical features associated with such Onsager\textendash Machlup minimizers. As there is a growing literature that addresses transition path sampling by related techniques, these insights add a potentially useful perspective into the interpretation of this body of work.},

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation\textendash dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

  abstract = {Stochastic Calculus for Finance evolved from the first ten years of the Carnegie Mellon Professional Master's program in Computational Finance. The content of this book has been used successfully with students whose mathematics background consists of calculus and calculus-based probability. The text gives both precise statements of results, plausibility arguments, and even some proofs, but more importantly intuitive explanations developed and refine through classroom experience with this material are provided. The book includes a self-contained treatment of the probability theory needed for stochastic calculus, including Brownian motion and its properties. Advanced topics include foreign exchange models, forward measures, and jump-diffusion processes. This book is being published in two volumes. The first volume presents the binomial asset-pricing model primarily as a vehicle for introducing in the simple setting the concepts needed for the continuous-time theory in the second volume. Chapter summaries and detailed illustrations are included. Classroom tested exercises conclude every chapter. Some of these extend the theory and others are drawn from practical problems in quantitative finance. Advanced undergraduates and Masters level students in mathematical finance and financial engineering will find this book useful. Steven E. Shreve is Co-Founder of the Carnegie Mellon MS Program in Computational Finance and winner of the Carnegie Mellon Doherty Prize for sustained contributions to education.},

In this paper we show that advance knowledge of the location of these modes can be incorporated into the MCMC sampler by introducing mode-hopping moves that satisfy detailed balance. The proposed sampling algorithm explores local mode structure through local MCMC moves (e.g. diffusion or Hybrid Monte Carlo) but in addition also represents the relative strengths of the different modes correctly using a set of global moves. This ``mode-hopping'' MCMC sampler can be viewed as a generalization of the darting method [1].},

  abstract = {IntroductionDuring the long development time of the theory of stochastic processes in nonlinear dynamical systems many approximate methods of calculation of various stochastic characteristics have been worked out for the Markov and non-Markov cases. There are two different equivalent approaches to the problem of the Markov case. Stochastic differential equations are used in the first approach, and the Fokker\textendash Planck equation for time-dependent probability density is applied in the second. One must know how to pass from the stochastic differential equation to the Fokker\textendash Planck equation and vice versa, so choosing the most appropriate method of solving the problem. Therefore at the beginning of this chapter we consider the rules governing the choice of method mentioned above and the different interpretations of stochastic differential equations are also considered.It is a well-known fact that there are two basic interpretations, each of them having its own advantages. The first is the Ito interpretation. Using this interpretation one can easily write the drifts if the stochastic differential equation is known (generally speaking, the rules of averaging are simpler in this interpretation). This is the advantage of the Ito interpretation. The other interpretation is the S-interpretation. In it the stochastic differential equation is more simply transformed when the nonlinear change of variables is made, and the form of the stochastic S-equation coincides with the form of the pre-limit stochastic differential equation. This is the advantage of the S-interpretation.},

Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

  abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

First, we briefly review the currently-known approximation results for finite- and infinite-dimensional equations. Then the author's results are preceded by the introduction of two new forms of correction terms in infinite dimensions appearing in the Wong-Zakai approximations. Finally, these results are divided into four parts: for stochastic delay equations, for semilinear and nonlinear stochastic equations in abstract spaces, and for the Navier-Stokes equations. We emphasize in this paper results rather than proofs. Some applications are indicated.},

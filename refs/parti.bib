Here it is argued that both actions are equivalent prescriptions for the purposes of reweighting and sampling trajectories, whereas the most probable path is more generally given by the global minimum of the action involving the second derivative term. The answer to this apparent paradox lies in the non-differentiable character of Brownian paths, as well as in the "entropy" associated with a given trajectory.},

Obtaining such understanding could lead to improved control of crystallization, as well as insight into polymorph selection in general, but is hampered by limited experimental resolution. Direct molecular dynamics simulations using atomistic force fields could provide such insight, but are not feasible for moderate undercooling, due to the rare event nature of nucleation. Instead, we harvest ensembles of the rare unbiased nucleation trajectories by employing transition path sampling. We find that with decreasing undercooling the mechanism shifts from amorphous to crystalline polymorph formation. At intermediate temperature the 2 mechanisms compete. Reaction coordinate analysis reveals the amount of a specific methane cage type is crucial for crystallization, while irrelevant for amorphous solids. Polymorph selection is thus governed by kinetic accessibility of the correct cage type and, moreover, occurs at precritical nucleus sizes, apparently against Ostwald's step rule. We argue that these results are still in line with classical nucleation theory. Our findings illuminate how selection between competing methane hydrate polymorphs occurs and might generalize to other hydrates and molecular crystal formation.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inverse problems often involve sampling posterior distributions on infinite-dimensional function spaces. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are characterized by deteriorating mixing times upon mesh-refinement, when the finite-dimensional approximations become more accurate. Such methods are typically forced to reduce step-sizes as the discretization gets finer, and thus are expensive as a function of dimension. Recently, a new class of MCMC methods with mesh-independent convergence times has emerged. However, few of them take into account the geometry of the posterior informed by the data. At the same time, recently developed geometric MCMC algorithms have been found to be powerful in exploring complicated distributions that deviate significantly from elliptic Gaussian laws, but are in general computationally intractable for models defined in infinite dimensions. In this work, we combine geometric methods on a finite-dimensional subspace with mesh-independent infinite-dimensional approaches. Our objective is to speed up MCMC mixing times, without significantly increasing the computational cost per step (for instance, in comparison with the vanilla preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) method). This is achieved by using ideas from geometric MCMC to probe the complex structure of an intrinsic finite-dimensional subspace where most data information concentrates, while retaining robust mixing times as the dimension grows by using pCN-like methods in the complementary subspace. The resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the context of three challenging inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, heat conduction and incompressible flow control. The algorithms exhibit up to two orders of magnitude improvement in sampling efficiency when compared with the pCN method.},

In contrast with standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it generates nonlocal, nonsymmetric moves in the state space, alleviating random walk type behaviour for the simulated trajectories. However, similarly to algorithms based on random walk or Langevin proposals, the number of steps required to explore the target distribution typically grows with the dimension of the state space. We define a generalized HMC algorithm which overcomes this problem for target measures arising as finite-dimensional approximations of measures {$\pi$} which have density with respect to a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The key idea is to construct an MCMC method which is well defined on the Hilbert space itself. We successively address the following issues in the infinite-dimensional setting of a Hilbert space: (i) construction of a probability measure {$\Pi$} in an enlarged phase space having the target {$\pi$} as a marginal, together with a Hamiltonian flow that preserves {$\Pi$}; (ii) development of a suitable geometric numerical integrator for the Hamiltonian flow; and (iii) derivation of an accept/reject rule to ensure preservation of {$\Pi$} when using the above numerical integrator instead of the actual Hamiltonian flow. Experiments are reported that compare the new algorithm with standard HMC and with a version of the Langevin MCMC method defined on a Hilbert space.},

The method is based on recent theory concerning stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) reversible with respect to the target bridge, derived by applying the Langevin idea on the bridge pathspace. In the process, a Random-Walk Metropolis algorithm and an Independence Sampler are also obtained. The novel algorithmic idea of the paper is that proposed moves for the MCMC algorithm are determined by discretising the SPDEs in the time direction using an implicit scheme, parametrised by \texttheta{} {$\in$} [0,1]. We show that the resulting infinite-dimensional MCMC sampler is well-defined only if \texttheta{} = 1/2, when the MCMC proposals have the correct quadratic variation. Previous Langevin-based MCMC methods used explicit schemes, corresponding to \texttheta{} = 0. The significance of the choice \texttheta{} = 1/2 is inherited by the finite-dimensional approximation of the algorithm used in practice. We present numerical results illustrating the phenomenon and the theory that explains it. Diffusion bridges (with additive noise) are representative of the family of laws defined as a change of measure from Gaussian distributions on arbitrary separable Hilbert spaces; the analysis in this paper can be readily extended to target laws from this family and an example from signal processing illustrates this fact.},

  abstract = {{$\phi$}-Value analysis remains the only experimental method that can give detailed structural information on protein folding transition states. Calculating {$\phi$}-values from simulations is therefore an important validation of inferred folding mechanisms but has remained challenging. We describe a novel method for computing {$\phi$}-values from folding transition paths, motivated by transition path theory. In addition to rendering an average {$\phi$}-value, our approach can characterize pathway heterogeneity by resolving {$\phi$} into contributions from individual transition paths. This method should be applicable not just to protein folding but to other complex self-assembly processes including protein binding or nucleic acid folding., All-atom molecular dynamics simulations now allow us to create movies of proteins folding and unfolding. However, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the folding mechanisms observed because experiments cannot yet directly resolve events occurring along the transition paths between unfolded and folded states. Protein folding {$\phi$}-values provide residue-resolved information about folding mechanisms by comparing the effects of mutations on folding rates and stability, but determining {$\phi$}-values by separately simulating mutant proteins would be computationally demanding and prone to large statistical errors. Here we use transition path theory to develop a method for computing {$\phi$}-values directly from the transition path ensemble, without the need for additional simulations. This path-based approach uses the full transition path information available from equilibrium folding and unfolding trajectories, or from transition path sampling, and does not require identification of folding transition states. Applying our approach to a set of simulations of 10 small proteins by Shaw and coworkers [Lindorff-Larsen K, Piana S, Dror RO, Shaw DE (2011) Science 334(6055):517\textendash 520; Piana S, Lindorff-Larsen K, Shaw DE (2011) Biophys J 100(9):L47\textendash L49; and Piana S, Lindorff-Larsen K, Shaw DE (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(15):5915\textendash 5920], we find good agreement with experiments in most cases where data are available. We can further resolve the contributions to fractional {$\phi$}-values coming from partial contact formation versus transition path heterogeneity. Although in some cases, there is substantial heterogeneity of folding mechanism, in others, such as Ubiquitin, the mechanism is strongly conserved.},

We use a Bayesian formula relating the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles to identify transition states, rank reaction coordinates, and estimate rate coefficients. We also introduce a variational procedure to optimize reaction coordinates. The theory is illustrated with applications to protein folding and the dipole reorientation of an ordered water chain inside a carbon nanotube. To describe the folding of a simple model of a three-helix bundle protein, we variationally optimize the weights of a projection onto the matrix of native and nonnative amino acid contacts. The resulting one-dimensional reaction coordinate captures the folding transition state, with formation and packing of helix 2 and 3 constituting the bottleneck for folding.},

  abstract = {In the past 15 years transition path sampling (TPS) has evolved from its basic algorithm to an entire collection of methods and a framework for investigating rare events in complex systems. The methodology is applicable to a wide variety of systems and processes, ranging from transitions in small clusters or molecules to chemical reactions, phase transitions, and conformational changes in biomolecules. The basic idea of TPS is to harvest dynamical unbiased trajectories that connect a reactant with a product, by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure called shooting. This simple importance sampling yields the rate constants, the free energy surface, insight in the mechanism of the rare event of interest, and by using the concept of the committor, also access to the reaction coordinate. In the last decade extensions to TPS have been developed, notably the transition interface sampling (TIS) methods, and its generalization multiple state TIS. Combination with advanced sampling methods such as replica exchange and the Wang-Landau algorithm, among others, improves sampling efficiency. Notwithstanding the success of TPS, there are issues left to discuss, and, despite the method's apparent simplicity, many pitfalls to avoid. This paper discusses several of these issues and pitfalls: the choice of stable states and interface order parameters, the problem of positioning the TPS windows and TIS interfaces, the matter of convergence of the path ensemble, the matter of kinetic traps, and the question whether TPS is able to investigate and sample Markov state models. We also review the reweighting technique used to join path ensembles. Finally we discuss the use of the sampled path ensemble to obtain reaction coordinates.},

  abstract = {The development of enhanced sampling methods to investigate rare but important events has always been a focal point in the molecular simulation field. Such methods often rely on prior knowledge of the reaction coordinate. However, the search for this reaction coordinate is at the heart of the rare event problem. Transition path sampling (TPS) circumvents this problem by generating an ensemble of dynamical trajectories undergoing the activated event. The reaction coordinate is extracted from the resulting path ensemble using variants of machine learning, making it an output of the method instead of an input. Over the last 20 years, since its inception, many extensions of TPS have been developed. Perhaps surprisingly, large-scale TPS simulations on complex molecular systems have become possible only recently. Other important developments include the transition interface sampling (TIS) methodology to compute rate constants, the application to multiple states, and adaptive path sampling. The development of OpenPathSampling and PyRETIS has enabled easy and flexible use and implementation of these and other novel path sampling algorithms. In this progress report, a brief overview of recent developments, novel algorithms, and software is given. In addition, several application areas are discussed, and a future outlook for the next decade is given.},

  abstract = {In stochastic systems with weak noise, the logarithm of the stationary distribution becomes proportional to a large deviation rate function called the quasi-potential. The quasi-potential, and its characterization through a variational problem, lies at the core of the Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations theory [32]. In many interacting particle systems, the particle density is described by fluctuating hydrodynamics governed by Macroscopic Fluctuation Th?eory [6], which formally fits within Freidlin-Wentzell's framework with a weak noise proportional to 1/ N , where N is the number of particles. The quasi-potential then appears as a natural generalization of the equilibrium free energy to non-equilibrium particle systems. A key physical and practical issue is to actually compute quasi-potentials from their variational characterization for non-equilibrium systems for which detailed balance does not hold. We discuss how to perform such a computation perturbatively in an external parameter {$\lambda$}, starting from a known quasi-potential for {$\lambda$} = 0. In a general setup, explicit iterative formulae for all terms of the power-series expansion of the quasi-potential are given for the first time. The key point is a proof of solvability conditions that assure the existence of the perturbation expansion to all orders. We apply the perturbative approach to diffusive particles interacting through a mean-field potential. For such systems, the variational characterization of the quasi-potential was proven by Dawson and Gartner [18, 19]. Our perturbative analysis provides new explicit results about the quasi-potential and about fluctuations of one-particle observables in a simple example of mean field diffusions: the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model of coupled rotators [74]. This is one of few systems for which non-equilibrium free energies can be computed and analyzed in an effective way, at least perturbatively.},

  abstract = {Rare weather and climate events, such as heat waves and floods, can bring tremendous social costs. Climate data is often limited in duration and spatial coverage, and climate forecasting has often turned to simulations of climate models to make better predictions of rare weather events. However very long simulations of complex models, in order to obtain accurate probability estimates, may be prohibitively slow. It is an important scientific problem to develop probabilistic and dynamical techniques to estimate the probabilities of rare events accurately from limited data. In this paper we compare four modern methods of estimating the probability of rare events: the generalized extreme value (GEV) method from classical extreme value theory; two importance sampling techniques, geneaological particle analysis (GPA) and the Giardina-Kurchan-Lecomte-Tailleur (GKLT) algorithm; as well as brute force Monte Carlo (MC). With these techniques we estimate the probabilities of rare events in three dynamical models: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the Lorenz '96 system and PlaSim (a climate model). We keep the computational effort constant and see how well the rare event probability estimation of each technique compares to a gold standard afforded by a very long run control. Somewhat surprisingly we find that classical extreme value theory methods outperform GPA, GKLT and MC at estimating rare events.},

These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

  abstract = {Binary fluid mixtures are examples of complex fluids whose microstructure and flow are strongly coupled. For pairs of simple fluids, the microstructure consists of droplets or bicontinuous demixed domains and the physics is controlled by the interfaces between these domains. At continuum level, the structure is defined by a composition field whose gradients \textendash{} which are steep near interfaces \textendash{} drive its diffusive current. These gradients also cause thermodynamic stresses which can drive fluid flow. Fluid flow in turn advects the composition field, while thermal noise creates additional random fluxes that allow the system to explore its configuration space and move towards the Boltzmann distribution. This article introduces continuum models of binary fluids, first covering some well-studied areas such as the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase separation, and emulsion stability. We then address cases where one of the fluid components has anisotropic structure at mesoscopic scales creating nematic (or polar) liquid-crystalline order; this can be described through an additional tensor (or vector) order parameter field. We conclude by outlining a thriving area of current research, namely active emulsions, in which one of the binary components consists of living or synthetic material that is continuously converting chemical energy into mechanical work. Such activity can be modelled with judicious additional terms in the equations of motion for simple or liquid-crystalline binary fluids. Throughout, the emphasis of the article is on presenting the theoretical tools needed to address a wide range of physical phenomena. Examples include the kinetics of fluid\textendash fluid demixing from an initially uniform state; the result of imposing a steady macroscopic shear flow on this demixing process; and the diffusive coarsening, Brownian motion and coalescence of emulsion droplets. We discuss strategies to create long-lived emulsions by adding trapped species, solid particles, or surfactants; to address the latter, we outline the theory of bending energy for interfacial films. In emulsions where one of the components is liquid-crystalline, `anchoring' terms can create preferential orientation tangential or normal to the fluid\textendash fluid interface. These allow droplets of an isotropic fluid in a liquid crystal (or               vice versa               ) to support a variety of topological defects, which we describe, altering their interactions and stability. Addition of active terms to the equations of motion for binary simple fluids creates a model of `motility-induced' phase separation, where demixing stems from self-propulsion of particles rather than their interaction forces, altering the relation between interfacial structure and fluid stress. Coupling activity to binary liquid crystal dynamics creates models of active liquid-crystalline emulsion droplets. Such droplets show various modes of locomotion, some of which strikingly resemble the swimming or crawling motions of biological cells.},

The basic assumption is that the rare event used in the conditioning is a large deviation-type event, characterized by a convex rate function. Under this assumption, we construct the driven process via a generalization of Doob's h-transform, used in the context of bridge processes, and show that this process is equivalent to the conditioned process in the long-time limit. The notion of equivalence that we consider is based on the logarithmic equivalence of path measures and implies that the two processes have the same typical states. In constructing the driven process, we also prove equivalence with the so-called exponential tilting of the Markov process, often used with importance sampling to simulate rare events and giving rise, from the point of view of statistical mechanics, to a nonequilibrium version of the canonical ensemble. Other links between our results and the topics of bridge processes, quasi-stationary distributions, stochastic control, and conditional limit theorems are mentioned.},

Our method is particularly useful for investigating Fokker-Planck dynamics and the physics of stringlike objects such as polymers. To give some examples, we derive the time evolution of the d-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and of the Van der Pol oscillator driven by white noise. Moreover, we compute the end-to-end transition probability for a charged string at thermal equilibrium, when an external field is applied.},

Examples include Bayesian nonparametric statistics and conditioned diffusion processes. Standard MCMC algorithms typically become arbitrarily slow under the mesh refinement dictated by nonparametric description of the unknown function. We describe an approach to modifying a whole range of MCMC methods, applicable whenever the target measure has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, which ensures that their speed of convergence is robust under mesh refinement. Gaussian processes or random fields are fields whose marginal distributions, when evaluated at any finite set of \$N\$ points, are \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{N\}\$-valued Gaussians. The algorithmic approach that we describe is applicable not only when the desired probability measure has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, but also to some useful non-Gaussian reference measures constructed through random truncation. In the applications of interest the data is often sparse and the prior specification is an essential part of the overall modelling strategy. These Gaussian-based reference measures are a very flexible modelling tool, finding wide-ranging application. Examples are shown in density estimation, data assimilation in fluid mechanics, subsurface geophysics and image registration. The key design principle is to formulate the MCMC method so that it is, in principle, applicable for functions; this may be achieved by use of proposals based on carefully chosen time-discretizations of stochastic dynamical systems which exactly preserve the Gaussian reference measure. Taking this approach leads to many new algorithms which can be implemented via minor modification of existing algorithms, yet which show enormous speed-up on a wide range of applied problems.},

Their success dates back to Feynman who showed how to use them within the framework of quantum mechanics. Since then, path integrals have pervaded all areas of physics where fluctuation effects, quantum and/or thermal, are of paramount importance. Their appeal is based on the fact that one converts a problem formulated in terms of operators into one of sampling classical paths with a given weight. Path integrals are the mirror image of our conventional Riemann integrals, with functions replacing the real numbers one usually sums over. However, unlike conventional integrals, path integration suffers a serious drawback: in general, one cannot make non-linear changes of variables without committing an error of some sort. Thus, no path-integral based calculus is possible. Here we identify which are the deep mathematical reasons causing this important caveat, and we come up with cures for systems described by one degree of freedom. Our main result is a construction of path integration free of this longstanding problem, through a direct time-discretization procedure.},

This work introduces a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers that can adapt to the particular structure of a posterior distribution over functions. Two distinct lines of research intersect in the methods developed here. First, we introduce a general class of operator-weighted proposal distributions that are well defined on function space, such that the performance of the resulting MCMC samplers is independent of the discretization of the function. Second, by exploiting local Hessian information and any associated low-dimensional structure in the change from prior to posterior distributions, we develop an inhomogeneous discretization scheme for the Langevin stochastic differential equation that yields operator-weighted proposals adapted to the non-Gaussian structure of the posterior. The resulting dimension-independent and likelihood-informed (DILI) MCMC samplers may be useful for a large class of high-dimensional problems where the target probability measure has a density with respect to a Gaussian reference measure. Two nonlinear inverse problems are used to demonstrate the efficiency of these DILI samplers: an elliptic PDE coefficient inverse problem and path reconstruction in a conditioned diffusion.},

In the RPI method, tunneling splitting is evaluated from the properties of the minimum action path (MAP) connecting the symmetric wells, whereby the extensive sampling of the full potential energy surface of the exact quantum-dynamics methods is avoided. Nevertheless, the search for the MAP is usually the most time-consuming step in the standard numerical procedures. Recently, nudged elastic band (NEB) and string methods, originaly developed for locating minimum energy paths (MEPs), were adapted for the purpose of MAP finding with great efficiency gains [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 787]. In this work, we develop a new quadratic string method for locating instantons. The Euclidean action is minimized by propagating the initial guess (a path connecting two wells) over the quadratic potential energy surface approximated by means of updated Hessians. This allows the algorithm to take many minimization steps between the potential/gradient calls with further reductions in the computational effort, exploiting the smoothness of potential energy surface. The approach is general, as it uses Cartesian coordinates, and widely applicable, with computational effort of finding the instanton usually lower than that of determining the MEP. It can be combined with expensive potential energy surfaces or on-the-fly electronic-structure methods to explore a wide variety of molecular systems.},

It characterizes the difficulty of the escape from the neighborhood of an attractor of a stochastic non-gradient dynamical system due to the influence of small white noise. It also gives an estimate of the invariant probability distribution in the neighborhood of the attractor up to the exponential order. We present a new family of methods for computing the quasi-potential on a regular mesh named the ordered line integral methods (OLIMs). In comparison with the first proposed quasi-potential finder based on the ordered upwind method (OUM) (Cameron in Phys D Nonlinear Phenom 241:1532\textendash 1550, 2012), the new methods are 1.5\textendash 4 times faster, can produce error two to three orders of magnitude smaller, and may exhibit faster convergence. Similar to the OUM, OLIMs employ the dynamical programming principle. Contrary to it, they (1) have an optimized strategy for the use of computationally expensive triangle updates leading to a notable speed-up, and (2) directly solve local minimization problems using quadrature rules instead of solving the corresponding Hamilton\textendash Jacobi-type equation by the first order finite difference upwind scheme. The OLIM with the right-hand quadrature rule is equivalent to OUM. The use of higher order quadrature rules in local minimization problems dramatically boosts up the accuracy of OLIMs. We offer a detailed discussion on the origin of numerical errors in OLIMs and propose rules-of-thumb for the choice of the important parameter, the update factor, in the OUM and OLIMs. Our results are supported by extensive numerical tests on two challenging 2D examples.},

The method employs a variational optimization of a control force that renders the rare event a typical one, supplying an exact estimate of its rate as a ratio of path partition functions. Using this method we find that increasing activity in the active bath can enhance the rate of conformational switching of the passive solute in a manner consistent with recent bounds from stochastic thermodynamics.},

The resulting equation is considerably different from the phenomenological equations usually used to describe the dynamics of non-conserved (model A) and conserved (model B) particle systems. The major feature is that the spatial white noise for this system appears not additively but multiplicatively. This simply expresses the fact that the density cannot fluctuate in regions devoid of particles. The steady state for the density function may, however, still be recovered formally as a functional integral over the coursed grained free energy of the system as in models A and B.},

Using a detailed R-L-C circuit as our illustrative example, this article describes how geometric features of the global Lyapunov function constructed, along with partial trajectory information from time domain simulations, can be used to more efficiently predict which branches are subject to failure in a specific disturbance scenario. The underlying concepts are closely related to techniques of merging families of Lyapunov functions in hybrid system analysis. It is hoped that these techniques will add to the set of tools available for predicting and preventing cascading failure in large scale networks.},

It included analytic and numerical computational techniques. One of the goals was to encourage cross-fertilization between these various aspects and disciplines. The first week was focused on quantum and classical systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom; the second week on field theories. During the first week the basic course, given by P. Cartier, was a presentation of a recent rigorous approach to functional integration which does not resort to discretization, nor to analytic continuation. It provides a definition of functional integrals simpler and more powerful than the original ones. Could this approach accommodate the works presented by the other lecturers? Although much remains to be done before answering "Yes," there seems to be no major obstacle along the road. The other courses taught during the first week presented: a) a solid introduction to functional numerical techniques (A. Sokal) and their applications to functional integrals encountered in chemistry (N. Makri). b) integrals based on Poisson processes and their applications to wave propagation (S. K. Foong), in particular a wave-restorer or wave-designer algorithm yielding the initial wave profile when one can only observe its distortion through a dissipative medium. c) the formulation of a quantum equivalence principle (H. Kleinert) which. given the flat space theory, yields a well-defined quantum theory in spaces with curvature and torsion.},

For a typical model problem in subsurface flow, we then provide a detailed analysis of these assumptions and show significant gains over the standard Metropolis--Hastings estimator. Numerical experiments confirm the analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with consistent reductions of more than an order of magnitude in the cost of the multilevel estimator over the standard Metropolis--Hastings algorithm for tolerances  {$\mathsl{E}<$} 10 -2 {$\epsilon<$}10-2 .},

However, it suffers from a notorious issue that the functional is unbounded below when the specified transition time T goes to infinity. This hinders the interpretation of the results obtained by minimizing the OM functional. We provide a new perspective on this issue. Under mild conditions, we show that although the infimum of the OM functional becomes unbounded when T goes to infinity, the sequence of minimizers does contain convergent subsequences on the space of curves. The graph limit of this minimizing subsequence is an extremal of the abbreviated action functional, which is related to the OM functional via the Maupertuis principle with an optimal energy. We further propose an energy-climbing geometric minimization algorithm (EGMA) which identifies the optimal energy and the graph limit of the transition path simultaneously. This algorithm is successfully applied to several typical examples in rare event studies. Some interesting comparisons with the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional are also made.},

The design problem we consider is temperature selection for the infinite swapping scheme, which is the limit of the widely used parallel tempering scheme obtained when the swap rate tends to infinity. We use a recently developed tool for the analysis of the empirical measure of a small noise diffusion to transform the variance reduction problem into an explicit optimization problem. Our first analysis of the optimization problem is in the setting of a double well model, and it shows that the optimal selection of temperature ratios is a geometric sequence except possibly the highest temperature. In the same setting we identify two different sources of variance reduction, and show how their competition determines the optimal highest temperature. In the general multi-well setting we prove that a pure geometric sequence of temperature ratios is always nearly optimal, with a performance gap that decays geometrically in the number of temperatures.},

To this end, we deploy the so-called instanton formalism that corresponds to a saddle-point approximation of the action in the path integral formulation of the underlying SPDE. The crucial step in our approach is the formulation of an alternative SPDE that incorporates knowledge of the instanton solution such that we are able to constrain the dynamical evolutions around extreme ow con gurations only. Finally, a reweighting procedure based on the Girsanov theorem is applied to recover the full distribution function of the original system. The entire procedure is demonstrated on the example of the one-dimensional Burgers equation. Furthermore, we compare our method to conventional direct numerical simulations as well as to Hybrid Monte Carlo methods. It will be shown that the instanton-based sampling method outperforms both approaches and allows for an accurate quanti cation of the whole probability density function of velocity gradients from the core to the very far tails.},

The action is discretized and a preconditioned BFGS method is used to optimize the discrete action. Applications are presented for thermally activated reversal in the Ginzburg-Landau model in one and two dimensions, and for noise-induced excursion events in the Brusselator taken as an example of a nongradient system arising in chemistry. In the Ginzburg-Landau model, the reversal proceeds via interesting nucleation events, followed by propagation of domain walls. The issue of nucleation versus propagation is discussed, and the scaling for the number of nucleation events as a function of the reversal time and other material parameters is computed. Good agreement is found with the numerical results. In the Brusselator, whose deterministic dynamics has a single stable equilibrium state, the presence of noise is shown to induce large excursions by which the system cycles out of this equilibrium state.}

This work offers a rigorous and detailed introduction to the foundations of this theory, up to and including such advanced topics as orbital-dependent functionals as well as both time-dependent and relativistic DFT. Given the many ramifications of contemporary DFT, the text concentrates on the self-contained presentation of the basics of the most widely used DFT variants: this implies a thorough discussion of the corresponding existence theorems and effective single particle equations, as well as of key approximations utilized in implementations. The formal results are complemented by selected quantitative results, which primarily aim at illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of particular approaches or functionals. The structure and content of this book allow a tutorial and modular self-study approach: the reader will find that all concepts of many-body theory which are indispensable for the discussion of DFT - such as the single-particle Green's function or response functions - are introduced step by step, along with the actual DFT material. The same applies to basic notions of solid state theory, such as the Fermi surface of inhomogeneous, interacting systems. In fact, even the language of second quantization is introduced systematically in an Appendix for readers without formal training in many-body theory.},

In this review, a broad account of transition path sampling approaches is provided, starting from the general concepts, progressing to the specific principles that underlie some of the most important methods, and eventually singling out the so-called forward flux sampling method for a more detailed description. This is done because forward flux sampling, despite its appealing simplicity and potential efficiency, has thus far received limited attention from practitioners. While path sampling methods have a widespread application to many types of rare transitional events, here only recent applications involving biomolecules are reviewed, including isomerization, protein folding, and enzyme catalysis.},

The approach is based on the formal analogy between thermal and quantum diffusion: by writing the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for the time-evolution of a protein in a viscous heat-bath in terms of a path integral, we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi variational principle from which we are able to compute the most probable pathway of folding. The method is applied to the folding of the Villin Headpiece Subdomain, in the framework of a Go-model. We have found that, in this model, the transition occurs through an initial collapsing phase driven by the starting coil configuration and a later rearrangement phase, in which secondary structures are formed and all computed paths display strong similarities. This method is completely general, does not require the prior knowledge of any reaction coordinate and represents an efficient tool to perfom ab-initio simulations of the entire folding process with available computers.},

This paper presents a robust and efficient algorithm for reconstructing random media, which can then be fed into stochastic finite element solvers for statistical response analysis. The new method is based on nonlinear transformation of Gaussian random fields, and the reconstructed media can meet the discrete-valued marginal probability distribution function and the two-point correlation function of the reference medium. The new method, which avoids iterative root-finding computation, is highly efficient and particularly suitable for reconstructing large-size random media or a large number of samples. Also, benefiting from the high efficiency of the proposed reconstruction scheme, a Karhunen\textendash Lo\`eve (KL) representation of the target random medium can be efficiently estimated by projecting the reconstructed samples onto the KL basis. The resulting uncorrelated KL coefficients can be further expressed as functions of independent Gaussian random variables to obtain an approximate Gaussian representation, which is often required in stochastic finite element analysis.

  abstract = {The computation of free energies is a common issue in statistical physics. A natural technique to compute such high dimensional integrals is to resort to Monte Carlo simulations. However these techniques generally suffer from a high variance in the low temperature regime, because the expectation is often dominated by high values corresponding to rare system trajectories. A standard way to reduce the variance of the estimator is to modify the drift of the dynamics with a control enhancing the probability of rare event, leading to so-called importance sampling estimators. In theory, the optimal control leads to a zero-variance estimator; it is however defined implicitly and computing it is of the same difficulty as the original problem. We propose here a general strategy to build approximate optimal controls in the small temperature limit for diffusion processes, with the first goal to reduce the variance of free energy Monte Carlo estimators. Our construction builds upon low noise asymptotics by expanding the optimal control around the instanton, which is the path describing most likely fluctuations at low temperature. This technique not only helps reducing variance, but it is also interesting as a theoretical tool since it differs from usual small temperature expansions (WKB ansatz). As a complementary consequence of our expansion, we provide a perturbative formula for computing the free energy in the small temperature regime, which refines the now standard Freidlin--Wentzell asymptotics. We compute this expansion explicitly for lower orders, and explain how our strategy can be extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy. We support our findings with illustrative numerical examples.},

Evidence is building that rough paths will play an important role in the future analysis of stochastic partial differential equations and the authors include some first results in this direction.

Chem. Phys. 133, 224105 (2010) https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3510519.]. The basic idea of this method is that the system we want to study (for example, some molecular system described by molecular mechanics) is coupled to a coarse-grained (CG) system, which can move more quickly and can be computed more efficiently than the original system. We simulate this combined system (original + CG system) using Langevin dynamics where different heat baths are coupled to the two systems. When the coupling is strong enough, the original system is guided by the CG system, and is able to sample the configuration and path space with more efficiency. We need to correct the bias caused by the coupling, however, by employing the Hamiltonian replica exchange, where we prepare many path replicas with different coupling strengths. As a result, an unbiased path ensemble for the original system can be found in the weakest coupling path ensemble. This strategy is easily implemented because a weight for a path calculated by the OM action is formally the same as the Boltzmann weight if we properly define the path ``Hamiltonian.'' We apply this method to a model polymer with Asakura-Oosawa interaction, and compare the results with the conventional transition path sampling method.},

Further, in response to the revolution in ?nancial m- kets following from the discovery by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes of a reliable option pricing formula, I have written a chapter on the application of stochastic me- ods to ?nancial markets. In doing this, I have not restricted myself to the geometric Brownian motion model, but have also attempted to give some ?avour of the kinds of methods used to take account of the realities of ?nancial markets. This means that I have also given a treatment of Levy{\' } processes and their applications to ?nance, since these are central to most current thinking. Since this book was written the rigorous mathematical formulation of stochastic processes has developed considerably, most particularly towards greater precision and generality, and this has been re?ected in the way the subject is presented in m- ern applications, particularly in ?nance.},

These properties, which include multistability and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits such as the bacteriophage {$\lambda$} switch2 and the Cyanobacteria circadian oscillator3. However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch\textemdash a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network\textemdash in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

To ensure that this growing power of simulations is harnessed correctly, and meaningful results are achieved, care must be taken to ensure the validity and reproducibility of these simulations.

Because of the short time scales and microscopic length scales involved, the dynamics of this autoionization have not been directly probed by experiment. Here, the autoionization mechanism is revealed by sampling and analyzing ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. We identify the rare fluctuations in solvation energies that destabilize an oxygen-hydrogen bond. Through the transfer of protons along a hydrogen bond "wire," the nascent ions separate by three or more neighbors. If the hydrogen bond wire connecting the two ions is subsequently broken, a metastable charge-separated state is visited. The ions may then diffuse to large separations. If, however, the hydrogen bond wire remains unbroken, the ions recombine rapidly. Because of their concomitant large electric fields, the transient ionic species produced in this case may provide an experimentally detectable signal of the dynamics we report.},

The aim is to give a treatment of the elements of the calculus of variations in a form both easily understandable and sufficiently modern. Considerable attention is devoted to physical applications of variational methods, e.g., canonical equations, variational principles of mechanics, and conservation laws.The reader who merely wishes to become familiar with the most basic concepts and methods of the calculus of variations need only study the first chapter. Students wishing a more extensive treatment, however, will find the first six chapters comprise a complete university-level course in the subject, including the theory of fields and sufficient conditions for weak and strong extrema. Chapter 7 considers the application of variational methods to the study of systems with infinite degrees of freedom, and Chapter 8 deals with direct methods in the calculus of variations. The problems following each chapter were made specially for this English-language edition, and many of them comment further on corresponding parts of the text. Two appendices and suggestions for supplementary reading round out the text.Substantially revised and corrected by the translator, this inexpensive new edition will be welcomed by advanced undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics and physics.},

When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

  abstract = {Summary. The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis\textendash Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

They are equivalent to minimizers of the related Freidlin\textendash Wentzell action and known to be able to characterize rare events in such systems. While there is an impressive body of work concerning their analytical description, this review focuses on the question on how to compute these minimizers numerically. In a short introduction we present the relevant mathematical and physical background before we discuss the stochastic Burgers equation in detail. We present algorithms to compute instantons numerically by an efficient solution of the corresponding Euler\textendash Lagrange equations. A second focus is the discussion of a recently developed numerical filtering technique that allows to extract instantons from direct numerical simulations. In the following we present modifications of the algorithms to make them efficient when applied to two- or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) fluid dynamical problems. We illustrate these ideas using the 2D Burgers equation and the 3D Navier\textendash Stokes equations.},

  abstract = {Small random perturbations may have a dramatic impact on the long time evolution of dynamical systems, and large deviation theory is often the right theoretical framework to understand these effects. At the core of the theory lies the minimization of an action functional, which in many cases of interest has to be computed by numerical means. Here we review the theoretical and computational aspects behind these calculations, and propose an algorithm that simplifies the geometric minimum action method to minimize the action in the space of arc-length parametrized curves. We then illustrate this algorithm's capabilities by applying it to various examples from material sciences, fluid dynamics, atmosphere/ocean sciences, and reaction kinetics. In terms of models, these examples involve stochastic (ordinary or partial) differential equations with multiplicative noise, Markov jump processes, and systems with fast and slow degrees of freedom, which all violate detailed balance, so that simpler computational methods are not applicable.},

The approach gives exponential estimates that often need to be refined via calculation of a prefactor. Here it is shown how to perform these computations in practice. Specifically, sharp asymptotic estimates are derived for expectations, probabilities, and mean first passage times in a form that is geared towards numerical purposes: they require solving well-posed matrix Riccati equations involving the minimizer of the Freidlin-Wentzell action as input, either forward or backward in time with appropriate initial or final conditions tailored to the estimate at hand. The usefulness of our approach is illustrated on several examples. In particular, invariant measure probabilities and mean first passage times are calculated in models involving stochastic partial differential equations of reaction-advection-diffusion type.},

  abstract = {IntroductionThe two most prominent branches of macroscopic physics, reversible classical mechanics and reversible equilibrium thermodynamics, are both characterized by extremum principles \textendash{} the principle of stationary action for a classical trajectory, and the principle of maximum entropy for thermodynamic equilibrium in a closed system. It is well known how both of these extremum principles arise by taking the macroscopic limit of more fundamental underlying microscopic theories, in which these extremum principles do not hold: quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, respectively. In these microscopic theories the extremum principles are violated by the occurrence of fluctuations; quantum fluctuations by which finite probability amplitudes are assigned to nonclassical trajectories, and classical fluctuations which assign nonzero probabilities to states with less than the maximum entropy. Hence, there is a deep connection in physics between fluctuation phenomena and extremum principles, the former providing a mechanism allowing the system to explore a neighbourhood of the extremizing state and thereby to identify the extremum.The last decade has seen a considerable increase of interest in non-equilibrium phenomena in macroscopic systems, as it was realized that simple and rather general mechanisms of self-organization exist in such systems (cf., e.g. Haken, 1977, 1983; Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977), leading to the selection, formation and competition of patterns in space and (or) time. The evolution equations governing these nonequilibrium phenomena neither belong to the realm of equilibrium thermodynamics, therefore thermodynamic extremum principles are not applicable, nor to the realm of reversible classical mechanics covered by the principle of least action.},

The mean exit time, the moment-generating function and the survival probability are then expressed through confluent hypergeometric functions and thoroughly analyzed. We also present a rapidly converging series representation of confluent hypergeometric functions that is particularly well suited for numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the governing Fokker\textendash Planck operator. We discuss several applications of first exit times, such as the detection of time intervals during which motor proteins exert a constant force onto a tracer in optical tweezers single-particle tracking experiments; adhesion bond dissociation under mechanical stress; characterization of active periods of trend-following and mean-reverting strategies in algorithmic trading on stock markets; relation to the distribution of first crossing times of a moving boundary by Brownian motion.

Our method aims at rare events, which currently cannot be predicted with traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, since these currently are limited to time scales shorter than a few nanoseconds. Given an initial conformation of the system, our method identifies one or more product states, which may be separated from the initial state by free energy barriers that are large on the scale of thermal energy. It also provides an approximate reaction path, which can be used to determine barrier heights or reaction rates with the usual techniques. The method employs an artificial potential that destabilizes the initial conformation and, thereby, lowers free energy barriers of structural transitions. As a result, transitions are accelerated and may be observed in MD simulations. An analytical estimate for the acceleration factor is given. The method is applied to two test systems, an argon microcluster and a simplified protein model. By these studies we demonstrated that our method is capable of shortening mean transition times from 0.5 {$\mu$}s (argon cluster) and 1.4 ns (protein model) to a few picoseconds. These results suggest that our method is particularly well suited to study biochemically relevant conformational motions in proteins at a microsecond time scale.},

The SPDE may be viewed as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Langevin equation used in finite-dimensional sampling. In this paper, conditioned nonlinear SDEs, leading to nonlinear SPDEs for the sampling, are studied. In addition, a class of preconditioned SPDEs is studied, found by applying a Green's operator to the SPDE in such a way that the invariant measure remains unchanged; such infinite dimensional evolution equations are important for the development of practical algorithms for sampling infinite dimensional problems. The resulting SPDEs provide several significant challenges in the theory of SPDEs. The two primary ones are the presence of nonlinear boundary conditions, involving first order derivatives, and a loss of the smoothing property in the case of the pre-conditioned SPDEs. These challenges are overcome and a theory of existence, uniqueness and ergodicity is developed in sufficient generality to subsume the sampling problems of interest to us. The Gaussian theory developed in Part I of this paper considers Gaussian SDEs, leading to linear Gaussian SPDEs for sampling. This Gaussian theory is used as the basis for deriving nonlinear SPDEs which affect the desired sampling in the nonlinear case, via a change of measure.},

We consider the Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithm that adds an accept\textendash reject mechanism to a Markov chain proposal in order to make the chain reversible with respect to the target measure. We focus on cases where the proposal is either a Gaussian random walk (RWM) with covariance equal to that of the reference measure or an Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck proposal (pCN) for which the reference measure is invariant. Previous results in terms of scaling and diffusion limits suggested that the pCN has a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension while the RWM method has undesirable dimension-dependent behaviour. We confirm this claim by exhibiting a dimension-independent Wasserstein spectral gap for pCN algorithm for a large class of target measures. In our setting this Wasserstein spectral gap implies an \$L\^\{2\}\$-spectral gap. We use both spectral gaps to show that the ergodic average satisfies a strong law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and nonasymptotic bounds on the mean square error, all dimension independent. In contrast we show that the spectral gap of the RWM algorithm applied to the reference measures degenerates as the dimension tends to infinity.},

Specifically, a numerical algorithm is proposed to compute the quasi-potential in the theory, which is the key object to quantify the dynamics on long time scales when the effect of the noise becomes ubiquitous: the equilibrium distribution of the system, the pathways of transition between metastable states and their rate, etc., can all be expressed in terms of the quasi-potential. We propose an algorithm to compute these quantities called the geometric minimum action method (gMAM), which is a blend of the original minimum action method (MAM) and the string method. It is based on a reformulation of the large deviations action functional on the space of curves that allows one to easily perform the double minimization of the original action required to compute the quasi-potential. The theoretical background of the gMAM in the context of large deviations theory is discussed in detail, as well as the algorithmic aspects of the method. The gMAM is then illustrated on several examples: a finite-dimensional system displaying bistability and modeled by a nongradient stochastic ordinary differential equation, an infinite-dimensional analogue of this system modeled by a stochastic partial differential equation, and an example of a bistable genetic switch modeled by a Markov jump process. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {We analyse MCMC chains focusing on how to find simulation parameters that give good mixing for discrete time, Harris ergodic Markov chains on a general state space X having invariant distribution {$\pi$}. The analysis uses an upper bound for the variance of the probability estimate. For each simulation parameter set, the bound is estimated from an MCMC chain using recurrence intervals. Recurrence intervals are a generalization of recurrence periods for discrete Markov chains. It is easy to compare the mixing properties for different simulation parameters. The paper gives general advice on how to improve the mixing of the MCMC chains and a new methodology for how to find an optimal acceptance rate for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Several examples, both toy examples and large complex ones, illustrate how to apply the methodology in practice. We find that the optimal acceptance rate is smaller than the general recommendation in the literature in some of these examples.},

However, such simple 1:1 mapping must now give place to the modern concepts of gene regulatory networks and gene expression noise. Both can, in the absence of genetic mutations, jointly generate a diversity of inheritable randomly occupied phenotypic states that could also serve as a substrate for natural selection. This form of epigenetic dynamics challenges Neo-Darwinism. It needs to incorporate the non-linear, stochastic dynamics of gene networks. A first step is to consider the mathematical correspondence between gene regulatory networks and Waddington's metaphoric 'epigenetic landscape', which actually represents the quasi-potential function of global network dynamics. It explains the coexistence of multiple stable phenotypes within one genotype. The landscape's topography with its attractors is shaped by evolution through mutational re-wiring of regulatory interactions - offering a link between genetic mutation and sudden, broad evolutionary changes.},

Because primitive hydrophobic effects can be tied to the probability of observing a molecular-sized cavity in the solvent, the probability distribution of the number of solvent centers in a cavity volume is modeled on the basis of the two moments available from the density and radial distribution of oxygen atoms in liquid water. The modeled distribution then yields the probability that no solvent centers are found in the cavity volume. This model is shown to account quantitatively for the central hydrophobic phenomena of cavity formation and association of inert gas solutes. The connection of information theory to statistical thermodynamics provides a basis for clarification of hydrophobic effects. The simplicity and flexibility of the approach suggest that it should permit applications to conformational equilibria of nonpolar solutes and hydrophobic residues in biopolymers.},

Unlike what their name suggests, rare events are fairly ubiquitous in nature, as the occurrence of many structural transformations in biology and material sciences is predicated upon crossing large free energy barriers. Probing the kinetics and uncovering the molecular mechanisms of possible barrier crossings in a system is critical to predicting and controlling its structural and functional properties. Due to their activated nature, however, rare events are exceptionally difficult to study using conventional experimental and computational techniques. In recent decades, a wide variety of specialized computational techniques\textemdash known as advanced sampling techniques\textemdash have been developed to systematically capture improbable fluctuations relevant to rare events. In this perspective, we focus on a technique called forward flux sampling [Allen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 124, 024102 (2006)] and overview its recent methodological variants and extensions. We also provide a detailed overview of its application to study a wide variety of rare events and map out potential avenues for further explorations.},

First, we discuss a PT (parity-time) symmetry that appears in ensembles of trajectories where a current is constrained to have a large (non-typical) value. We analyse the heat flow in such ensembles, and compare it with non-equilibrium steady states. Second, we consider pathwise large deviations that are defined by considering many copies of a system. We show how the probability currents in such systems can be decomposed into orthogonal contributions that are related to convergence to equilibrium and to dissipation. We discuss the implications of these results for modelling non-equilibrium steady states.},

We regularise this definition by considering, instead, the limiting ratio of probabilities for trajectories to remain in the tubular neighbourhood of a smooth path and its time reversal. We show that this leads to an expression for the pathwise medium entropy production that is in agreement with the formal expression from stochastic thermodynamics and devise a procedure for its measurement as a difference of exit rates from tubes. Applying the procedure to bivariate Langevin dynamics yields excellent agreement between measurement and theory. Our work enables the measurement of irreversibility along individual paths in configuration space.},

The most probable path between two states (the instanton) and the leading term in the logarithm of the process transition density (the quasipotential) are obtained from the minimum of the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional. Here we present a Ritz method that searches for the minimum in a space of paths constructed from a global basis of Chebyshev polynomials. The action is reduced, thereby, to a multivariate function of the basis coefficients, whose minimum can be found by nonlinear optimization. For minimization regardless of path duration, this procedure is most effective when applied to a reparametrization-invariant ``on-shell'' action, which is obtained by exploiting a Noether symmetry and is a generalization of the scalar work [Olender and Elber, J. Mol. Struct: THEOCHEM 398, 63 (1997)] for gradient dynamics and the geometric action [Heyman and Vanden-Eijnden (2008)] for nongradient dynamics. Our approach provides an alternative to chain-of-states methods for minimum energy paths and saddle points of complex energy landscapes and to Hamilton-Jacobi methods for the stationary quasipotential of circulatory fields. We demonstrate spectral convergence for three benchmark problems involving the M\"uller-Brown potential, the Maier-Stein force field, and the Egger weather model.},

This activity has been as strong in the engineering and physical sciences as it has in mathematics, resulting inevitably in some duplication of effort due to an unfamiliarity with the developments in other disciplines. Much of the reported work has been motivated by the need to solve particular types of problems, for which, even more so than in the deterministic context, specific methods are required. The treatment has often been heuristic and ad hoc in character.

We obtain strong and weak error bounds for the truncation procedure and show that, under suitable conditions, the mean square error has order of convergence \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{m\})\$ and the second moment has a weak order of convergence \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{m\})\$, where \$m\$ denotes the size of the expansion. We also discuss efficient numerical linear algebraic techniques to approximate the series of matrix functions and the linearized system of differential equations.

  abstract = {Inverse problems lend themselves naturally to a Bayesian formulation, in which the quantity of interest is a posterior distribution of state and/or parameters given some uncertain observations. For the common case in which the forward operator is smoothing, then the inverse problem is ill-posed. Well-posedness is imposed via regularization in the form of a prior, which is often Gaussian. Under quite general conditions, it can be shown that the posterior is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior and it may be well-defined on function space in terms of its density with respect to the prior. In this case, by constructing a proposal for which the prior is invariant, one can define Metropolis\textendash Hastings schemes for MCMC which are well-defined on function space (Stuart (2010) [1], Cotter et~al.~ [2]), and hence do not degenerate as the dimension of the underlying quantity of interest increases to infinity, e.g. under mesh refinement when approximating PDE in finite dimensions. However, in practice, despite the attractive theoretical properties of the currently available schemes, they may still suffer from long correlation times, particularly if the data is very informative about some of the unknown parameters. In fact, in this case it may be the directions of the posterior which coincide with the (already known) prior which decorrelate the slowest. The information incorporated into the posterior through the data is often contained within some finite-dimensional subspace, in an appropriate basis, perhaps even one defined by eigenfunctions of the prior. We aim to exploit this fact and improve the mixing time of function-space MCMC by careful rescaling of the proposal. To this end, we introduce two new basic methods of increasing complexity, involving (i) characteristic function truncation of high frequencies and (ii) Hessian information to interpolate between low and high frequencies. The second, more sophisticated version, bears some similarities with recent methods which exploit local curvature information, for example RMHMC, Girolami and Calderhead (2011) [3], and stochastic Newton, Martin et~al. (2012)~ [4]. These ideas are illustrated with numerical experiments on the Bayesian inversion of the heat equation and Navier\textendash Stokes equation, given noisy observations.},

This method upgrades an underlying Markov chain by allowing an ensemble of such chains to interact via a process in which one chain's state is cloned as another's is deleted. This effective teleportation of states can overcome issues of metastability in the underlying chain, as the scheme enjoys rapid mixing once the modes of the target density have been populated. We derive a mean-field limit for the evolution of the ensemble. We analyze the global and local convergence of this mean-field limit, showing asymptotic convergence independent of the spectral gap of the underlying Markov chain, and moreover we interpret the limiting evolution as a gradient flow. We explain how interaction can be applied selectively to a subset of state variables in order to maintain advantage on very high-dimensional problems. Finally we present the application of our methodology to Bayesian hyperparameter estimation for Gaussian process regression.},

We first consider the landscape of the quasi-potential near the limit cycle, which characterizes the minimal cost of the noise to drive the system far away form the limit cycle. We derive and compute the quadratic approximation of this quasi-potential near the limit cycle in the form of a positive definite solution to a matrix-valued periodic Riccati differential equation on the limit cycle. We then combine this local approximation in the neighborhood of the limit cycle with the minimum action method applied outside of the neighborhood. The neighborhood size is selected to be compatible with the path discretization error. By several numerical examples, we show that this strategy effectively improves the minimum action method to compute the spiral optimal escape path from limit cycles in various systems.},

The second half is devoted to a detailed study of Independ\- ence which played and continues to playa central role both by itself and as a catalyst. The main additions consist of a section on convergence of probabilities on metric spaces and a chapter whose first section on domains of attrac\- tion completes the study of the Central limit problem, while the second one is devoted to random walks. About a third of the second volume is devoted to conditioning and properties of sequences of various types of dependence.

  abstract = {The design of analogue electronic experiments to investigate phenomena in nonlinear dynamics, especially stochastic phenomena, is described in practical terms. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach, in comparison to more conventional digital methods, are discussed. It is pointed out that analogue simulation provides a simple, inexpensive, technique that is easily applied in any laboratory to facilitate the design and implementation of complicated and expensive experimental projects; and that there are some important problems for which analogue methods have so far provided the only experimental approach. Applications to several topical problems are reviewed. Large rare fluctuations are studied through measurements of the prehistory probability distribution, thereby testing for the first time some fundamental tenets of fluctuation theory. It has thus been shown for example that, whereas the fluctuations of equilibrium systems obey time-reversal symmetry, those under non-equilibrium conditions are temporally asymmetric. Stochastic resonance, in which the signal-to-noise ratio for a weak periodic signal in a nonlinear system can be enhanced by added noise, has been widely studied by analogue methods, and the main results are reviewed; the closely related phenomena of noise-enhanced heterodyning and noiseinduced linearization are also described. Selected examples of the use of analogue methods for the study of transient phenomena in time-evolving systems are reviewed. Analogue experiments with quasimonochromatic noise, whose power spectral density is peaked at some characteristic frequency, have led to the discovery of a range of interesting and often counter-intuitive effects. These are reviewed and related to large fluctuation phenomena. Analogue studies of two examples of deterministic nonlinear effects, modulation-induced negative differential resistance (MINDR) and zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance (ZDNR) are described. Finally, some speculative remarks about possible future directions and applications of analogue experiments are discussed.},

We aim to give an efficient description of typical transition paths in the small temperature regime. We adopt a variational point of view and seek the best Gaussian approximation, with respect to Kullback--Leibler divergence, of the non-Gaussian distribution of the diffusion process. We interpret the mean of this Gaussian approximation as the ``most likely path,'' and the covariance operator as a means to capture the typical fluctuations around this most likely path. We give an explicit expression for the Kullback--Leibler divergence in terms of the mean and the covariance operator for a natural class of Gaussian approximations and show the existence of minimizers for the variational problem. Then the low temperature limit is studied via \$\textbackslash Gamma\$-convergence of the associated variational problem. The limiting functional consists of two parts: The first part depends only on the mean and coincides with the \$\textbackslash Gamma\$-limit of the rescaled Freidlin--Wentzell rate functional. The second part depends on both the mean and the covariance operator and is minimized if the dynamics are given by a time-inhomogenous Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process found by linearization of the Langevin dynamics around the Freidlin--Wentzell minimizer.},

We develop an automatic method for identifying these degrees of freedom from a database of candidate physical variables. In the method neural networks are used to determine the functional dependence of the probability of committing to a stable state (committor) on a set of coordinates, and a genetic algorithm selects the combination of inputs that yields the best fit. The method enables us to obtain the first set of coordinates that is demonstrably sufficient to specify the transition state of the C(7eq)--{$>$} alpha(R) isomerization of the alanine dipeptide in the presence of explicit water molecules. It is revealed that the solute-solvent coupling can be described by a solvent-derived electrostatic torque around one of the main-chain bonds, and the collective, long-ranged nature of this interaction accounts for previous failures to characterize this reaction.},

The approach is based on dynamical ensembles, determined by an action on trajectory space. (Anti)Symmetry under time-reversal separates two complementary contributions in the response, one entropic the other frenetic. Under time-reversal invariance of the unperturbed reference process, only the entropic term is present in the response, giving the standard fluctuation-dissipation relations in equilibrium. For nonequilibrium reference ensembles, the frenetic term contributes essentially and is responsible for new phenomena. We discuss modifications in the Sutherland-Einstein relation, the occurence of negative differential mobilities and the saturation of response. We also indicate how the Einstein relation between noise and friction gets violated for probes coupled to a nonequilibrium environment. We end with some discussion on the situation for quantum phenomena, but the bulk of the text concerns classical mesoscopic (open) systems. The choice of many simple examples is trying to make the notes pedagogical, to introduce an important area of research in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.},

  abstract = {Chemists visualize chemical reactions as motion along one-dimensional ``reaction coordinates'' over free energy barriers. Various rate theories, such as transition state theory and the Kramers theory of diffusive barrier crossing, differ in their assumptions regarding the mathematical specifics of this motion. Direct experimental observation of the motion along reaction coordinates requires single-molecule experiments performed with unprecedented time resolution. Toward this goal, recent single-molecule studies achieved time resolution sufficient to catch biomolecules in the act of crossing free energy barriers as they fold, bind to their targets, or undergo other large structural changes, offering a window into the elusive reaction ``mechanisms''. This Perspective describes what we can learn (and what we have already learned) about barrier crossing dynamics through synergy of single-molecule experiments, theory, and molecular simulations. In particular, I will discuss how emerging experimental data can be used to answer several questions of principle. For example, is motion along the reaction coordinate diffusive, is there conformational memory, and is reduction to just one degree of freedom to represent the reaction mechanism justified? It turns out that these questions can be formulated as experimentally testable mathematical inequalities, and their application to experimental and simulated data has already led to a number of insights. I will also discuss open issues and current challenges in this fast evolving field of research.}

We then discuss the case of amphiphilic and dipolar Janus particles. Finally, we show how the geometry of the colloids and/or the directionality of their interactions can be used to control the physical properties of the assembled active aggregates, and we suggest possible strategies for how to exploit activity as a tunable driving force for self-assembly. The unique properties of active colloids lend promise to the design of the next generation of functional, environment-sensing microstructures able to perform specific tasks in an autonomous and targeted manner.}

To probe rare transitions, we use the Onsager-Machlup (OM) functional as a path probability distribution function for double-ended paths that are constrained to start and stop at predesignated points after a fixed time. We explore the continuous-time limit where the OM functional has been commonly regularized by using the Ito-Girsanov change of measure. When used as a path measure, the Ito-Girsanov expression generates an ensemble of doubleended paths that are unphysical. We expose the underlying reasons why this continuous-time limit does not, and cannot, generate a thermodynamic ensemble of paths. Furthermore, we show that the concept of the Most Probable Path and the Thermodynamic action are incompatible with such measures for discrete or continuous time diffusion processes.},

When two species compete, and the population dynamics have multiple equilibria, a barrier crossing corresponds to fluctuations driving the populations across a deterministic separatrix. Similarly, fluctuation may drive quantitative traits across valleys in the surface of individual fitness, particularly when the fluctuations interact with a deterministic force such as a correlated selection reponse. In this paper, I show how to formulate and solve the barrier crossing problem. Two classes of models are considered. In models based on stochastic differential or difference equations, fluctuations are superimposed upon a system of deterministic differential or difference equations. In the case of a Markov chain, there may be no underlying deterministic system, so that the system is only characterized by Markovian transition probabilities. The validity of the diffusion approximation and the origin of macroscopic population dynamics from a underlying purely probabilistic system are investigated.},

First, we validate and benchmark the HMC algorithm by reproducing multiscale properties of the one-dimensional Burgers equation driven by Gaussian and white-in-time noise. Second, we show how to implement an importance sampling protocol to significantly enhance, by orders of magnitudes, the probability to sample extreme and rare events, making it possible to estimate moments of field variables of extremely high order (up to 30 and more). By employing reweighting techniques, we map the biased configurations back to the original probability measure in order to probe their statistical importance. Finally, we show that by biasing the system towards very intense negative gradients, the HMC algorithm is able to explore the statistical fluctuations around instanton configurations. Our results will also be interesting and relevant in lattice gauge theory since they provide unique insights into reweighting techniques.},

Even if a system is in a steady state (invariant in time), Prigogine suggested that there should be a positive entropy production if it is open. In 1979, the first author of this paper and Qian Min-Ping discovered that the entropy production describes the irreversibility of stationary Markov chains, and proved the circulation decomposition formula of the entropy production. They also obtained the entropy production formula for drifted Brownian motions on Euclidean space Rn (see a report without proof in the Proc. 1st World Congr. Bernoulli Soc.). By the topological triviality of Rn, there is no discrete circulation associated to the diffusion processes on Rn. In this paper, the entropy production formula for stationary drifted Brownian motions on a compact Riemannian manifold M is proved. Furthermore, the entropy production is decomposed into two parts \textendash{} in addition to the first part analogous to that of a diffusion process on Rn, some discrete circulations intrinsic to the topology of M appear! The first part is called the hidden circulation and is then explained as the circulation of a lifted process on M \texttimes{} S1 around the circle S1. The main result of this paper is the circulation decomposition formula which states that the entropy production of a stationary drifted Brownian motion on M is a linear sum of its circulations around the generators of the fundamental group of M and the hidden circulation.},

  abstract = {The pH of liquid water is determined by the infrequent process in which water molecules split into short-lived hydroxide and hydronium ions. This reaction is difficult to probe experimentally and challenging to simulate. One of the open questions is whether the local water structure around a slightly stretched OH bond is actually initiating the eventual breakage of this bond or whether this event is driven by a global ordering that involves many water molecules far away from the reaction center. Here, we investigated the self-ionization of water at room temperature by rare-event ab initio molecular dynamics and obtained autoionization rates and activation energies in good agreement with experiments. Based on the analysis of thousands of molecular trajectories, we identified a couple of local order parameters and show that if a bond stretch occurs when all these parameters are around their ideal range, the chance for the first dissociation step (double-proton jump) increases from  1 0 -7 10-7  to  0.4 0.4 . Understanding these initiation triggers might ultimately allow the steering of chemical reactions.},

To localize an inverse problem is to enforce an anticipated ``local'' structure by (i ) neglecting small off-diagonal elements of the prior precision and covariance matrices; and (ii ) restricting the influence of observations to their neighborhood. For linear problems we can specify the conditions under which posterior moments of the localized problem are close to those of the original problem. We explain physical interpretations of our assumptions about local structure and discuss the notion of high dimensionality in local problems, which is different from the usual notion of high dimensionality in function space MCMC. The Gibbs sampler is a natural choice of MCMC algorithm for localized inverse problems and we demonstrate that its convergence rate is independent of dimension for localized linear problems. Nonlinear problems can also be tackled efficiently by localization and, as a simple illustration of these ideas, we present a localized Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler. Several linear and nonlinear numerical examples illustrate localization in the context of MCMC samplers for inverse problems.},

While theory suggests that many independent Markov chains may be run and their samples pooled, the well-known practical problem of quasi-ergodicity, or poor mixing, frustrates this otherwise simple approach. Furthermore, without some mechanism for hastening the convergence of individual chains, overall speedup from parallelism is limited by the portion of each chain to be discarded as burn-in. Existing multiple-chain methods, such as parallel tempering and population MCMC, use a synchronous exchange of samples to expedite convergence. This work instead proposes mixing in an additional independent proposal, representing some hitherto best estimate or summary of the posterior, and cooperatively adapting this across chains. Such adaptation can be asynchronous, increases the ensemble's robustness to quasi-ergodic behaviour in constituent chains, and may improve overall tolerance to fault.},

In this formulation the boundary and matching conditions fully determine the uniform expansion of the solution, without resorting to "external" selection criteria for the expansion coefficients, such as variational principles or the Lagrange identity, as in our previous theory. The exit density and the mean first passage time to the boundary are calculated from the solution of the stationary Fokker-Planck equation as the probability current density and as the inverse of the total flux on the boundary, respectively. As an application, a uniform expansion is constructed for the escape rate in Kramers' problem of activated escape from a potential well for the full range of the dissipation parameter.},

We begin by defining the notion of a functional and its role in performing calculus on variations of curves. In order to identify those functions which are extremals of a functional, we establish the first variation and the Euler-Lagrange Equations. A formulation of the second variation follows, providing a means of identifying different types of extremals. Both the first and second variations are illustrated using several examples. We then introduce the calculus of variations as it applies to classical mechanics, resulting in the Principle of Stationary Action, from which we develop the foundations of Lagrangian mechanics. Finally, we examine an extension of the calculus of variations in optimal control. We conclude with Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and its applications in control theory.},

Here we show that such an anomalous power-law scaling in time of large deviations can also arise without long-range correlations in Markovian processes as simple as the Langevin equation.

The results are compared with simulations based on importance sampling, extending our previous results based on direct Monte Carlo simulations.

  abstract = {Probabilistic models are conceptually powerful tools for finding structure in data, but their practical effectiveness is often limited by our ability to perform inference in them. Exact inference is frequently intractable, so approximate inference is often performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To achieve the best possible results from MCMC, we want to efficiently simulate many steps of a rapidly mixing Markov chain which leaves the target distribution invariant. Of particular interest in this regard is how to take advantage of multi-core computing to speed up MCMC-based inference, both to improve mixing and to distribute the computational load. In this paper, we present a parallelizable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for efficiently sampling from continuous probability distributions that can take advantage of hundreds of cores. This method shares information between parallel Markov chains to build a scale-mixture of Gaussians approximation to the density function of the target distribution. We combine this approximation with a recent method known as elliptical slice sampling to create a Markov chain with no step-size parameters that can mix rapidly without requiring gradient or curvature computations.},

  abstract = {When a system has more than one stable state, how can the stability of these states be compared? This deceptively simple question has important consequences for ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo dramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of these shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states. Unfortunately, the concept of ``stability'' in ecology has suffered from substantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where stochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable states. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a ball-in-cup-diagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the position of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push the ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by a potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. Systems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite rare, however. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other approaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear stability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and, as we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will behave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how the potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly, employing a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential. Using three classic ecological models, we demonstrate that the quasi-potential provides a useful way to quantify stability in stochastic systems. We show that the quasi-potential framework helps clarify long-standing confusion about stability in stochastic ecological systems, and we argue that ecologists should adopt it as a practical tool for analyzing these systems.},

Our results are applicable for both linear and nonlinear subthreshold dynamics, and in certain cases may be extended to correlated subthreshold noise sources. We also show how this optimal voltage may be used to obtain approximations to (1) the likelihood that an IF cell with a given set of parameters was responsible for the observed spike train; and (2) the instantaneous firing rate and interspike interval distribution of a given noisy IF cell. The latter probability approximations are based on the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations principles for stochastic differential equations.

The book contains a large number of illustrations, examples, and exercises. It will be useful for graduate-level courses on stochastic processes for students in applied mathematics, physics and engineering. Many of the topics covered in this book (reversible diffusions, convergence to equilibrium for diffusion processes, inference methods for stochastic differential equations, derivation of the generalized Langevin equation, exit time problems) cannot be easily found in textbook form and will be useful to both researchers and students interested in the applications of stochastic processes.},

  abstract = {Reaction Rate Theory and Rare Events bridges the historical gap between these subjects because the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of scientific research often requires an understanding of both reaction rate theory and the theory of other rare events. The book discusses collision theory, transition state theory, RRKM theory, catalysis, diffusion limited kinetics, mean first passage times, Kramers theory, Grote-Hynes theory, transition path theory, non-adiabatic reactions, electron transfer, and topics from reaction network analysis. It is an essential reference for students, professors and scientists who use reaction rate theory or the theory of rare events. In addition, the book discusses transition state search algorithms, tunneling corrections, transmission coefficients, microkinetic models, kinetic Monte Carlo, transition path sampling, and importance sampling methods. The unified treatment in this book explains why chemical reactions and other rare events, while having many common theoretical foundations, often require very different computational modeling strategies.},

  abstract = {To sample from complex, high-dimensional distributions, one may choose algorithms based on the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method. HMC-based algorithms generate nonlocal moves alleviating diffusive behavior. Here, I build on an already defined HMC framework, hybrid Monte Carlo on Hilbert spaces (Beskos, et al. Stoch. Proc. Applic. 2011), that provides finite-dimensional approximations of measures {$\pi$}, which have density with respect to a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert (path) space. In all HMC algorithms, one has some freedom to choose the mass operator. The novel feature of the algorithm described in this article lies in the choice of this operator. This new choice defines a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that is well defined on the Hilbert space itself. As before, the algorithm described herein uses an enlarged phase space {$\Pi$} having the target {$\pi$} as a marginal, together with a Hamiltonian flow that preserves {$\Pi$}. In the previous work, the authors explored a method where the phase space {$\pi$} was augmented with Brownian bridges. With this new choice, {$\pi$} is augmented by Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck (OU) bridges. The covariance of Brownian bridges grows with its length, which has negative effects on the acceptance rate in the MCMC method. This contrasts with the covariance of OU bridges, which is independent of the path length. The ingredients of the new algorithm include the definition of the mass operator, the equations for the Hamiltonian flow, the (approximate) numerical integration of the evolution equations, and finally, the Metropolis\textendash Hastings acceptance rule. Taken together, these constitute a robust method for sampling the target distribution in an almost dimension-free manner. The behavior of this novel algorithm is demonstrated by computer experiments for a particle moving in two dimensions, between two free-energy basins separated by an entropic barrier.},

An analog for finite temperature transitions is given by the Onsager\textendash Machlup functional. The purpose of this work is to investigate properties of Onsager\textendash Machlup minimizers. We study transition paths for thermally activated molecules governed by the Langevin equation in the overdamped limit of Brownian dynamics. Using gradient descent in pathspace, we minimize the Onsager\textendash Machlup functional for a range of model problems in one and two dimensions and then for some simple atomic models including Lennard-Jones seven-atom and 38-atom clusters, as well as for a model of vacancy diffusion in a planar crystal. Our results demonstrate interesting effects, which can occur at nonzero temperature, showing transition paths that could not be predicted on the basis of the zero temperature limit. However the results also demonstrate unphysical features associated with such Onsager\textendash Machlup minimizers. As there is a growing literature that addresses transition path sampling by related techniques, these insights add a potentially useful perspective into the interpretation of this body of work.},

When such transitions from one state to another take place, fluctuations, i.e., random processes, may play an im portant role. Over the past decades it has turned out that the Fokker-Planck equation pro vides a powerful tool with which the effects of fluctuations close to transition points can be adequately treated and that the approaches based on the Fokker Planck equation are superior to other approaches, e.g., based on Langevin equa tions. Quite generally, the Fokker-Planck equation plays an important role in problems which involve noise, e.g., in electrical circuits. For these reasons I am sure that this book will find a broad audience. It pro vides the reader with a sound basis for the study of the Fokker-Planck equation and gives an excellent survey of the methods of its solution. The author of this book, Hannes Risken, has made substantial contributions to the development and application of such methods, e.g., to laser physics, diffusion in periodic potentials, and other problems. Therefore this book is written by an experienced practitioner, who has had in mind explicit applications to important problems in the natural sciences and electrical engineering.},

  abstract = {Very often when studying non-equilibrium systems one is interested in analysing dynamical behaviour that occurs with very low probability, so called rare events. In practice, since rare events are by definition atypical, they are often difficult to access in a statistically significant way. What are required are strategies to ``make rare events typical'' so that they can be generated on demand. Here we present such a general approach to adaptively construct a dynamics that efficiently samples atypical events. We do so by exploiting the methods of reinforcement learning (RL), which refers to the set of machine learning techniques aimed at finding the optimal behaviour to maximise a reward associated with the dynamics. We consider the general perspective of dynamical trajectory ensembles, whereby rare events are described in terms of ensemble reweighting. By minimising the distance between a reweighted ensemble and that of a suitably parametrised controlled dynamics we arrive at a set of methods similar to those of RL to numerically approximate the optimal dynamics that realises the rare behaviour of interest. As simple illustrations we consider in detail the problem of excursions of a random walker, for the case of rare events with a finite time horizon; and the problem of a studying current statistics of a particle hopping in a ring geometry, for the case of an infinite time horizon. We discuss natural extensions of the ideas presented here, including to continuous-time Markov systems, first passage time problems and non-Markovian dynamics.},

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation\textendash dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

  abstract = {We present a model of a collection of active and adhesive Brownian particles that are capable of aggregation. Besides the mechanical interaction between particles, a simple active dynamics term (motility) is included to provide an active movement. At a given instant, each particle is either in an active (swim) or unanimated (stop) state, which is controlled by a random process. The model includes important features that are inspired by the phenomenon of biological cell- cell association. One feature is the mean motility that is related to the percentage of the particle being active and the maximum swimming speed. Another feature is the stochastic nature of switching between the swim and stop state. We explored how these key features affect the nucleation dynamics and the stability of the aggregates using simulations. Interestingly, particles can change their collective behavior by solely altering the frequency of switching between the swim and stop state while keeping the mean motility unchanged. These results provide insight into how motor-driven forces can be utilized by active biological systems to modulate the single-to-cluster transition efficiently. A dimensionless parameter is also proposed to measure the overall strength of the nonequilibrium effect on active particles.},

The book includes a self-contained treatment of the probability theory needed for stochastic calculus, including Brownian motion and its properties. Advanced topics include foreign exchange models, forward measures, and jump-diffusion processes. This book is being published in two volumes. The first volume presents the binomial asset-pricing model primarily as a vehicle for introducing in the simple setting the concepts needed for the continuous-time theory in the second volume. Chapter summaries and detailed illustrations are included. Classroom tested exercises conclude every chapter. Some of these extend the theory and others are drawn from practical problems in quantitative finance. Advanced undergraduates and Masters level students in mathematical finance and financial engineering will find this book useful. Steven E.

  abstract = {IntroductionDuring the long development time of the theory of stochastic processes in nonlinear dynamical systems many approximate methods of calculation of various stochastic characteristics have been worked out for the Markov and non-Markov cases. There are two different equivalent approaches to the problem of the Markov case. Stochastic differential equations are used in the first approach, and the Fokker\textendash Planck equation for time-dependent probability density is applied in the second. One must know how to pass from the stochastic differential equation to the Fokker\textendash Planck equation and vice versa, so choosing the most appropriate method of solving the problem. Therefore at the beginning of this chapter we consider the rules governing the choice of method mentioned above and the different interpretations of stochastic differential equations are also considered.It is a well-known fact that there are two basic interpretations, each of them having its own advantages. The first is the Ito interpretation. Using this interpretation one can easily write the drifts if the stochastic differential equation is known (generally speaking, the rules of averaging are simpler in this interpretation). This is the advantage of the Ito interpretation. The other interpretation is the S-interpretation. In it the stochastic differential equation is more simply transformed when the nonlinear change of variables is made, and the form of the stochastic S-equation coincides with the form of the pre-limit stochastic differential equation. This is the advantage of the S-interpretation.},

This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

  abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

  abstract = {Background Recent experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein folding kinetics can be quite complex and diverse depending on various factors such as size of the protein sequence and external conditions. For example, some proteins fold apparently in a kinetically two-state manner, whereas others follow complex routes to the native state. We have set out to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diverse behavior seen in the refolding kinetics of proteins in terms of properties that are intrinsic to the sequence. Results: The folding kinetics of a number of sequences for off-lattice continuum models of proteins is studied using Langevin simulations at two different values of the friction coefficient. We show for these models that there is a remarkable correlation between folding time, {$\tau$}F, and {$\sigma$}=(T\texttheta{} \textendash{} TF)/T\texttheta, where T\texttheta{} and TF are the equilibrium collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. The microscopic dynamics reveals that several scenarios for the kinetics of refolding arise depending on the range of values of {$\sigma$}. For relatively small {$\sigma$}, the chain reaches the native conformation by a direct native conformation nucleation collapse (NCNC) mechanism without being trapped in any detectable intermediates. For moderate and large values of {$\sigma$}, the kinetics is described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, according to which a fraction of molecules {$\Phi$} (kinetic partition factor) reach the native conformation via the NCNC mechanism. The remaining fraction attains the native state by off-pathway processes that involve trapping in several misfolded structures. The rate-determining step in the off-pathway processes is the transition from the misfolded structures to the native state. The partition factor {$\Phi$} is also determined by {$\sigma$}: the smaller the value of {$\sigma$}, the larger is {$\Phi$}. The qualitative aspects of our results are found to be independent of the friction coefficient. The simulation results and theoretical arguments are used to obtain estimates for timescales for folding via the NCNC mechanism in small proteins, those with less than about 70 amino acid residues. Conclusions We have shown that the various scenarios for folding of proteins, and possibly other biomolecules, can be classified solely in terms of {$\sigma$}. Proteins with small values of {$\sigma$} reach the native conformation via a nucleation collapse mechanism and their energy landscape is characterized by having one dominant native basin of attraction (NBA). On the other hand, proteins with large {$\sigma$} get trapped in competing basins of attraction (CBAs) in which they adopt misfolded structures. Only a small fraction of molecules access the native state rapidly when {$\sigma$} is large. For these sequences, the majority of the molecules approach the native state by a three-stage multipathway mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves a transition from one of the CBAs to the NBA.},

  abstract = {This review provides a pedagogic and self-contained introduction to master equations and to their representation by path integrals. Since the 1930s, master equations have served as a fundamental tool to understand the role of fluctuations in complex biological, chemical, and physical systems. Despite their simple appearance, analyses of master equations most often rely on low-noise approximations such as the Kramers\textendash Moyal or the system size expansion, or require ad-hoc closure schemes for the derivation of low-order moment equations. We focus on numerical and analytical methods going beyond the low-noise limit and provide a unified framework for the study of master equations. After deriving the forward and backward master equations from the Chapman\textendash Kolmogorov equation, we show how the two master equations can be cast into either of four linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Three of these PDEs are discussed in detail. The first PDE governs the time evolution of a generalized probability generating function whose basis depends on the stochastic process under consideration. Spectral methods, WKB approximations, and a variational approach have been proposed for the analysis of the PDE. The second PDE is novel and is obeyed by a distribution that is marginalized over an initial state. It proves useful for the computation of mean extinction times. The third PDE describes the time evolution of a `generating functional', which generalizes the so-called Poisson representation. Subsequently, the solutions of the PDEs are expressed in terms of two path integrals: a `forward' and a `backward' path integral. Combined with inverse transformations, one obtains two distinct path integral representations of the conditional probability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path integrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Moreover, we show how a wellknown path integral representation of averaged observables can be recovered from them.},

Coarse-grained models of this process show time-reversal symmetry (detailed balance) to be restored for uniform states, but broken by gradient terms; hence, detailed-balance violation is strongly coupled to interfacial phenomena. To explore the subtle generic physics resulting from such coupling, we here introduce `Active Model B'. This is a scalar {$\varphi$}4 field theory (or phase-field model) that minimally violates detailed balance via a leading-order square-gradient term. We find that this additional term has modest effects on coarsening dynamics, but alters the static phase diagram by creating a jump in (thermodynamic) pressure across flat interfaces. Both results are surprising, since interfacial phenomena are always strongly implicated in coarsening dynamics but are, in detailed-balance systems, irrelevant for phase equilibria.},

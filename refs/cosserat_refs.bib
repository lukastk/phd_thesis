  abstract = {Following a brief outline of the method of virtual power, the local equations of motion for a Cosserat surface with inextensible directors are derived by means of this method. The model obtained coincides with the results derived from three-dimensional theory by Simo and Fox. Subsequently the model is extended so as to account for deformable directors. Besides the linear-momentum and moment-of-momentum balance equations, one additional scalar equation is derived. This equation replaces the director-momentum balance equation of Naghdi and therefore eliminates the necessity of introducing constitutive restrictions. The equivalence between the model derived by the virtual-power method and the results from the direct method of Naghdi are finally noted.},

  abstract = {In this chapter we generalize the development of Chap. IV by formulating the general dynamical theory of rods that can undergo large deformations in space by suffering flexure, torsion, extension, and shear. We call the resulting geometrically exact theory the special Cosserat theory of rods. In Sec. 2 we outline an honest derivation of the governing equations for elastic and viscoelastic rods. Here we scarcely pause for motivation, interpretation, and justification of our results. The purpose of this presentation is twofold: to establish a framework for the ensuing careful treatment in subsequent sections and to demonstrate that there is a short and pleasant path leading from fundamental physical principles to the governing equations. Armed with these results, the reader interested in the treatment of concrete problems is ready to begin the following chapter. A full appreciation of the theory, however, requires a study of the topics covered in the remainder of the present chapter, which also serves as an easy entr\'ee into ideas important for three-dimensional theories of solids.},

The diverse phenomena exhibited by these systems all stem from the defining property of active matter as an assembly of components that individually and dissipatively break time-reversal symmetry.

The rod, which is assumed to undergo flexure about two principal axes, extension, shear and torsion, are described by a general geometrically exact theory. Based on the Cosserat theory, a set of governing partial differential equations of motion with arbitrary boundary conditions is formulated in terms of the displacements and angular variables, thus the dynamical analysis of elastic rods can be carried out rather simply. The case of doubly symmetric cross-section of the rod is considered and the Kirchoff constitutive relations are adopted to provide an adequate description of elastic properties in terms of a few elastic moduli. A cantilever is given as a simple example to demonstrate the use of the formulation developed. The nonlinear dynamic model with the corresponding boundary and initial conditions are numerically solved using the Femlab/Matlab software packages.

  abstract = {In this paper, the modelling strategy of a Cosserat rod element (CRE) is addressed systematically for 3-dimensional dynamical analysis of slender structures. We employ the exact nonlinear kinematic relationships in the sense of Cosserat theory, and adopt the Bernoulli hypothesis. For the sake of simplicity, the Kirchoff constitutive relations are adopted to provide an adequate description of elastic properties in terms of a few elastic moduli. A deformed configuration of the rod is described by the displacement vector of the deformed centroid curves and an orthonormal moving frame, rigidly attached to the cross-section of the rod. The position of the moving frame relative to the inertial frame is specified by the rotation matrix, parametrized by a rotational vector. The approximate solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations of motion in quasi-static sense are chosen as the shape functions with up to third order nonlinear terms of generic nodal displacements. Based on the Lagrangian constructed by the Cosserat kinetic energy and strain energy expressions, the principle of virtual work is employed to derive the ordinary differential equations of motion with third order nonlinear generic nodal displacements. A simple example is presented to illustrate the use of the formulation developed here to obtain the lower order nonlinear ordinary differential equations of motion of a given structure. The corresponding nonlinear dynamical responses of the structures have been presented through numerical simulations by Matlab software.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal pattern formation in systems driven away from equilibrium is presented, with emphasis on comparisons between theory and quantitative experiments. Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q0 and frequency {$\omega$}0 of the instability. Type Is systems ({$\omega$}0=0, q0{$\neq$}0) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type IIIo systems ({$\omega$}0{$\neq$}0, q0=0) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type Io systems ({$\omega$}0{$\neq$}0, q0{$\neq$}0) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via "amplitude equations," whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the "phase equation" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing "real pattern effects" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying "temporal chaos," where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics. A concluding section summarizes what has and has not been accomplished, and attempts to assess the prospects for the future.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the geometric integration of hamiltonian systems on Poisson manifolds, in particular, in the case, when the Poisson structure is induced by a Lie algebra, that is, it is a Lie-Poisson structure. A Hamiltonian system on a Poisson manifold \$(P, \textbackslash Pi)\$ is a smooth manifold \$P\$ equipped with a bivector field \$\textbackslash Pi\$ satisfying \$[\textbackslash Pi, \textbackslash Pi]=0\$ (Jacobi identity), inducing the Poisson bracket on \$C\^\{\textbackslash infty\}(P)\$, \$\textbackslash\{f, g\textbackslash\}\textbackslash equiv \textbackslash Pi(df, dg)\$ where \$f, g\textbackslash in C\^\{\textbackslash infty\}(P)\$. For any \$f\textbackslash in C\^\{\textbackslash infty\}(P)\$ the Hamiltonian vector field is defined by \$X\_f(g)=\textbackslash\{g, f\textbackslash\}\$. The Hamiltonian vector fields \$X\_f\$ generate an integrable generalized distribution on \$P\$ and the leaves of this foliation are symplectic. The flow of any hamiltonian vector field preserves the Poisson structure, it fixes each leaf and the hamiltonian itself is a first integral. It is important to characterize numerical methods preserving some of these fundamental properties of the hamiltonian flow on Poisson manifolds (geometric integrators). We discuss the difficulties of deriving these Poisson methods using standard techniques and we present some modern approaches to the problem.},

The different kinds of motion to be expected are classified in terms of the relative magnitudes, expressed in time scales, of inertia, viscosity, barrier energies and temperature. In particular, and as a comparison for other cases, the idealized case of a strictly inextensible, but otherwise freely flexible chain, is solved in detail. The nonlinear nature of the constraint is shown to lead to the generation of a Fokker-Planck equation. This Fokker-Planck equation shows that there are wave-like solutions to the motion for long wave fluctuations in the conformation of the chain (second sound) in the absence of viscosity. In the high viscosity limit the equation has Rouse-like solutions which correspond to short wave changes in conformation. In general, the equilibrium function is modified so that if the chain is considered as a series of connected mass points, the energy is k T per point, not \$kT, a result which though intuitively obvious, is difficult to establish. This idealized model can be related to several realistic cases but a reinterpretation of the constants is involved.},

We validate our simulations by solving a number of forward problems involving the mechanics of passive filaments and comparing them with known analytical results, and extend them to study instabilities in stretched and twisted filaments that form solenoidal and plectonemic structures. We then study active filaments such as snakes and other slender organisms by solving inverse problems to identify optimal gaits for limbless locomotion on solid surfaces and in bulk liquids.},

By shape we mean all those geometric features that are invariant under isometries of the three-dimensional ambient space. The representation of the shape as a path in the special Euclidean algebra is intrinsic to the description of the mechanical properties of a rod, since it is given directly in terms of the strain fields that stimulate the elastic response of special Cosserat rods. Moreover, such a representation leads naturally to discretization schemes that avoid the need for the expensive reconstruction of the strains from the discretized placement and for interpolation procedures which introduce some arbitrariness in popular numerical schemes. Given the shape of a rod and the positioning of one of its cross sections, the full placement in the ambient space can be uniquely reconstructed and described by means of a base curve endowed with a material frame. By viewing a geometric curve as a rod with degenerate point-like cross sections, we highlight the essential difference between rods and framed curves, and clarify why the family of relatively parallel adapted frames is not suitable for describing the mechanics of rods but is the appropriate tool for dealing with the geometry of curves.},

It is based on interpreting the strains and the generalized velocities of the cross sections as basic variables and elements of the special Euclidean algebra. This perspective emerges naturally from the evolution equations for strands, that are one-dimensional submanifolds, of the special Euclidean group. The discretization of the corresponding equations for the three-dimensional motion of a Cosserat rod is performed, in space, by using a staggered grid. The time evolution is then approximated with a semi-implicit method. Within this approach we can easily include dissipative effects due to both the action of external forces and the presence of internal mechanical dissipation. The comparison with results obtained with different schemes shows the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to provide very good predictions of nonlinear dynamical effects and shows competitive computation times also as an energy-minimizing method to treat static problems.},

The shapes of the cells serve important biological functions, both for cells within an intact tissue, and during embryogenesis and cellular motility. How cells control their shapes and the structures that they form on their surface has been a subject of intensive biological research, exposing the building blocks that cells use to deform their membranes. These processes have also drawn the interest of theoretical physicists, aiming to develop models based on physics, chemistry and nonlinear dynamics. Such models explore quantitatively different possible mechanisms that the cells can employ to initiate the spontaneous formation of shapes and patterns on their membranes. We review here theoretical work where one such class of mechanisms was investigated: the coupling between curved membrane proteins, and the cytoskeletal forces that they recruit. Theory indicates that this coupling gives rise to a rich variety of membrane shapes and dynamics, while experiments indicate that this mechanism appears to drive many cellular shape changes.

The first part follows the line of thought developed by professor Maugin and his students on complex continuous media subject to the objectivity requirement (translational and rotational invariances). The second part shows that this principle is extensible to other types of invariance such as gauge and scale invariances. Gauge invariance allows to express Maxwell equations, usually derived through a vector approach, by use of a scalar principle having the same formal structure as the principle of virtual power. As to scale invariance, it allows to deal, in a general and unified way whatever the underlying physics, with the passage from a continuous medium to a discontinuous one (singular surfaces, lines or points). The third part concerns the foundations of dynamics where the principle of virtual power appears as a theorem, like other analytical principles, each corresponding to one point of view, deductible from a general intrinsic (viewpoint independent) dynamical framework. The attention will be focused on the origin of the duality notion, at the basis of the principle of virtual power.},

The hyperelastic material is a special case of a Cauchy elastic material. For many materials, linear elastic models do not accurately describe the observed material behaviour.  The most common example of this kind of material is rubber, whose stress-strain relationship can be defined as non-linearly elastic, isotropic and incompressible.  Hyperelasticity provides a means of modeling the stress\textendash strain behavior of such materials. The behavior of unfilled, vulcanized elastomers often conforms closely to the hyperelastic ideal.  Filled elastomers and biological tissues are also often modeled via the hyperelastic idealization. Ronald Rivlin and Melvin Mooney developed the first hyperelastic models, the Neo-Hookean and Mooney\textendash Rivlin solids.  Many other hyperelastic models have since been developed.  Other widely used hyperelastic material models include the Ogden model and the Arruda\textendash Boyce model.},

Through their activation by muscular contraction or growth, these fibers will generate internal stresses that are partially relieved by the filament acquiring intrinsic torsion and curvature. This process is fundamental in morphogenesis but also in plant tropism, nematic solid activation, and muscular motion of filamentary organs such as elephant trunks and octopus arms. Here, we provide a general theory that links the activation of arbitrary fibers at the microscale to the generation of curvature and torsion at the macroscale. This theory is obtained by dimensional reduction from the full anelastic description of three-dimensional bodies to morphoelastic Kirchhoff rods. Hence, it links the geometry and material properties of embedded fibers to the shape and stiffness of the rod. The theory is applied to fibers that are wound helically around a central core in tapered and untapered filaments.},

The first is to determine the minimum energy conformations of semi-flexible polymers with end constraints, and the second is to perform normal mode analysis based on the determined minimum energy conformations. In this paper, we use concepts from the theory of Lie groups and principles of variational calculus to model such polymers as inextensible or extensible chiral elastic rods with coupling between twisting and bending stiffnesses, and/or between twisting and extension stiffnesses. This method is general enough to include any stiffness and chirality parameters in the context of elastic filament models with the quadratic elastic potential energy function. As an application of this formulation, the analysis of DNA conformations is discussed. We demonstrate our method with examples of DNA conformations in which topological properties such as writhe, twist, and linking number are calculated from the results of the proposed method. Given these minimum energy conformations, we describe how to perform the normal mode analysis. The results presented here build both on recent experimental work in which DNA mechanical properties have been measured, and theoretical work in which the mechanics of non-chiral elastic rods has been studied.},

The chaotic behavior here is basically due to the unstable growth of a spatial inhomogeneity taking place in an oscillating medium. It is argued that phase turbulence and amplitude turbulence have to be discriminated from each other according to their distinct origins. Two prototype equations describing respective types of turbulence are derived by means of some asymptotic methods, and their solutions turn out toe exhibit successive bifurcations. It is found that the phase turbulence arises essentially from the interaction among a few unstable phase modes, while the amplitude turbulence may well appear in the presence of only one unstable mode with is a mixed mode of the phase and amplitude. In particular, some similarity of the amplitude turbulence to the Lorenz chaos is pointed out. Throughout the present paper, the chaotic behavior is discucssed in connection with spatial pattern, so that no discrete approximations, such as a box-model or mode-truncation, are employed.},

We write these equations, called the Euler-Poincar\'e equations, under an intrinsic form, without any reference to a particular system of local coordinates, and prove that they can be conveniently expressed in terms of the Legendre and momentum maps. We discuss the use of the Euler-Poincar\'e equation for reduction (a procedure sometimes called Lagrangian reduction by modern authors), and compare this procedure with the well known Hamiltonian reduction procedure (formulated in modern terms in 1974 by J.E. Marsden and A. Weinstein). We explain how a break of symmetry in the phase space produces the appearance of a semi-direct product of groups.},

  abstract = {Zusammenfassung The Method of Virtual Power in Continuum Mechanics: Application to Coupled Fields. Using as main tools the principle of virtual power -- in the form recently favored by French mechanicians -- aud continuum thermodynamics, this work of a synt.hetic nature develops in a "rational" manner and from a unified viewpoint the fully dynamical (albeit 11ot relativistic) theory of electromagnetic continua. The resulting equations are those to be used by theoretical mechanicians, applied physicists and electronic engineers alike to study coupled electro-magneto-mechanical effects in electronic components. A fairly long account of the formal structure underlying the principle of virtual power is first given. Following then a simple purely mechanical application, a full illustration is given of the application of this principle to the theory of coupled fields in deformable continua, all s\textasciitilde ates of magnetism and dielectricity being representable if one makes the appropriate adjustments. Other illustrations of the method concern the case of complicated schemes of elastic dielectrics, liquid crystals and ferrofluids. To end with a comparison with other energy approaches used nowadays in continuum physics is given.},

We derive a new mathematical model using energy minimization approach and show that the model generates a variety of morphogen and curvature patterns agreeing with experimentally observed structures. The mechanism proposed transcends the classical Turing concept which requires interactions between two morphogens with a significantly different diffusivity. Our studies show how biomechanical forces may replace the elusive long-range inhibitor and lead to formation of stable spatially heterogeneous structures without existence of chemical prepatterns. We propose new experimental approaches to decisively test our central hypothesis that tissue curvature and morphogen expression are coupled in a positive feedback loop.},

Stable oscillations require a substantial source of dissipation to balance the energy input of motors. Conventionally, it stems from external fluid. We show, in contrast, that external fluid friction is negligible compared to internal elastic stress through a simultaneous measurement of motion and flow field of an isolated and active Chlamydomonas cilium beating near the instability threshold. Consequently, internal friction emerges as the sole source of dissipation for ciliary oscillations. We combine these experimental insights with theoretical modeling of active filaments to show that an instability to oscillations takes place when active stresses are strain softening and shear thinning. Together, our results reveal a counterintuitive mechanism of ciliary beating and provide a general experimental and theoretical methodology to analyze other active filaments, both biological and synthetic ones.},

The method also applies to the two-dimensional motion of such rods with unequal principal stiffnesses. For these two classes of problems the equations of the classical theory of rods are reduced to a non-linear vector equation of motion together with the inextensibility condition and appropriate boundary and initial conditions. Consistent finite-difference approximations are introduced and a semi-explicit method of solution is devised. The approximate limitation for numerical stability of the method is shown to be the same as for the usual explicit method in linear beam dynamics. By way of example the method is applied to the free fall of a circular pipe through water onto a rigid plane from a suspended initial configuration.},

These numerical integration schemes for differential equations on manifolds have been studied in a general and systematic manner since the 1990s and the activity has since then branched out in several different subareas, focussing both on theoretical and practical issues. From two alternative setups, using either frames or Lie group actions on a manifold, we here introduce the most important classes of schemes used to integrate nonlinear ordinary differential equations on Lie groups and manifolds. We describe a number of different applications where there is a natural action by a Lie group on a manifold such that our integrators can be implemented. An issue which is not well understood is the role of isotropy and how it affects the behaviour of the numerical methods. The order theory of numerical Lie group integrators has become an advanced subtopic in its own right, and here we give a brief introduction on a somewhat elementary level. Finally, we shall discuss Lie group integrators having the property that they preserve a symplectic structure or a first integral.},

  abstract = {A multisymplectic Lie algebra variational integrator (MLAVI) for simulating the dynamics of a flexible multibody system is proposed. The flexible bodies are described by the geometrically exact beam elements established on the special Euclidean Lie group SE(3). A lemma is also provided to demonstrate that the used discrete compatibility equation can make temporal and spatial interpolation independent. Then, the reduced Lagrangian density on the Lie algebra is derived, and the discrete dynamics of motions are established by the discretization of the covariant variational principle. Furthermore, another novel closed-form equality relation lemma on the right tangent maps of the associated exponential map and Cayley map is originally proved, which greatly helps to simplify the Jacobi matrix of the proposed MLAVI in the Newton iteration process. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed MLAVI are validated by six static and dynamic numerical examples. Numerical results show that the proposed MLAVI can preserve the system's symplectic structure, momentum, and energy for long-time simulation. In the present work, we have developed a nonlocal and nonlinear structure mechanics theory and computational formulations for the nonlinear stiffened shell with its stiffeners modeled by the three-dimensional geometrically exact beam model while the shell part is modeled by three-dimensional geometrically exact shell model. This hybrid beam-shell geometrically exact stiffened shell model is used for solving dynamic problems of stiffened shell structures, including dynamic fracture of the shell. We first formulate the nonlocal equations for geometrically nonlinear beams using the kinematics of geometrically exact beam theory. Then, we develop a stiffened shell model by coupling the nonlocal geometrically exact beam and shell formulations. Several numerical examples are presented to validate and verify both the nonlocal and nonlinear beam formulation and the nonlocal/nonlinear stiffened shell formulation. We have demonstrated that the proposed nonlocal stiffened shell theory can model the crack growth in stiffened shell structures. Experimental analyses and modeling of the draping of composite fiber reinforcements generally concern textiles where the fiber directions are orthogonal in the initial state. However, there also exist biaxial NCF (Non-Crimp Fabric) reinforcements, where the two fiber directions are non-orthogonal. One objective of this paper was to revisit the picture frame and bias extension tests in the case of such non-orthogonal NCFs in order to determine the in-plane shear behavior which is different for positive and negative shear angles. A simulation approach based on stress resultant shell elements was developed for these reinforcements by taking into account the specific plane shear behavior of non-orthogonal NCF reinforcements identified by picture frame tests. It was shown that simulations of non-orthogonal NCF (0\textendash 45\textdegree{} and 0/135\textdegree ) draping processes gave results that were consistent with experimental forming tests of these materials. In particular, the hemispherical forming of an NCF at 0\textendash 45\textdegree{} led to a very specific deformed shape with a good correlation between simulation and experiment. Some specificities of the 0\textendash 45\textdegree{} preforms, especially weak areas, have been highlighted both by simulation and experimentally. Morphological instabilities play a key role in the evolution of form and function in growing biomaterials. Spatially varying differential growth, in particular, leads to residual stresses that for soft materials or slender geometries are favourably relieved by out-of-plane buckling or wrinkling. While the onset of instability in growing biomaterials has been studied extensively, the post-critical regime remains poorly understood. To this end, this paper presents a robust computational modelling framework for morphoelastic instabilities and associated post-critical pattern formation. The seven-parameter shell element\textemdash commonly used for elasto-plastic analysis of engineering materials\textemdash is implemented alongside the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor into a growth and an elastic part. The governing nonlinear equations are solved using a generalised path-following/numerical continuation solver that facilitates comprehensive exploration of the stability landscape through pinpointing of critical points and branch switching at bifurcations. The utility and power of the computational framework is demonstrated by unveiling complex pattern formation phenomena that arise as a result of sequentially occurring morphological instabilities. In particular, we highlight the central role that exponential edge growth plays in fractal wrinkling patterns, the blooming of doubly-curved flower petals, and wavy daffodil trumpets. In addition, the ability of the solver to track critical points through parameter space enables efficient sensitivity studies into the role of material parameters on pattern formation. The presented computational framework is thus a versatile tool for modelling the evolution of form and function in growing biological systems and the design of biotechnology applications. Isogeometric analysis is an efficient method to accurately represent geometry and obtain accurate solutions, and can be utilized for dynamic analysis of flexible multibody systems.

Finally, the presented approach is validated with three examples. The dynamic response results show that the trimmed isogeometric analysis can be employed to achieve considerable accuracy. As the continuity between NURBS elements increases from C0 to C1, the degree of freedom is reduced by 75\%, and the computational time of l1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="italic" is="true"{$>$}l{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} norm based dynamic analysis is about 35\% of the full order modal shapes method. Furthermore, the proposed sampling method can be utilized to reduce the 33\% sampling number compared with the Latin Hypercube sampling method. To facilitate further gains in structural efficiency, the use of composite materials in engineering structures is on the rise. Simultaneously, a drive for thinner components is leading to structural behaviour that is governed by elastic nonlinearities such as large deflections and instabilities. For efficient and reliable design, numerical models must predict the nonlinear displacements, as well as the corresponding stress and strain responses, both accurately and at minimal computational cost. In this work, we present a novel tensor-based variable kinematics continuum shell (VKCS) formulation that is geometrically nonlinear in a total Lagrangian sense. The key contribution is the development and validation of a nonlinear continuum shell model that is completely general in terms of its geometric and kinematic descriptions. The governing equations are derived and presented in tensorial form, which enables a straightforward spatial mapping for models with complex curvatures. The `variable-kinematics' capability means that the element field variables can be refined in a hierarchical and orthotropic manner, i.e. the in-plane and through-thickness displacements can be independently discretised using any polynomial functions with arbitrary orders of expansion. With this feature, the model configurations can be tailored for specific nonlinear problems, whilst also achieving fast solution convergence rate through the use of higher-order basis functions. For validation, the VKCS model has been benchmarked against existing nonlinear problems in the literature that feature large displacements with complex equilibrium paths. In addition, we have proposed two new benchmarks to investigate the 3D Cauchy stress in a snapped shallow roof, and the postbuckling behaviour of a wind turbine blade section. The VKCS formulation is shown to be a versatile tool that allows the user to easily switch between a multitude of model configurations, and can thus accommodate the varying fidelity of analyses required across different design stages. Furthermore, our benchmarks have demonstrated that the variable-kinematics model requires fewer degrees of freedom and run time to track complex 3D stresses when compared to conventional low-order continuum elements.},

  abstract = {The variational formulation and computational aspects of a three-dimensional finite-strain rod model, considered in Part I, are presented. A particular parametrization is employed that bypasses the singularity typically associated with the use of Euler angles. As in the classical Kirchhoff-Love model, rotations have the standard interpretation of orthogonal, generally noncommutative, transformations. This is in contrast with alternative formulations proposed by Argyris et al. [5\textendash 8], based on the notion of semitangential rotation. Emphasis is placed on a geometric approach, which proves essential in the formulation of algorithms. In particular, the configuration update procedure becomes the algorithmic counterpart of the exponential map. The computational implementation relies on the formula for the exponential of a skew-symmetric matrix. Consistent linearization procedures are employed to obtain linearized weak forms of the balance equations. The geometric stiffness then becomes generally nonsymmetric as a result of the non-Euclidean character of the configuration space. However, complete symmetry is recovered at an equilibrium configuration, provided that the loading is conservative. An explicit condition for this to be the case is obtained. Numerical simulations including postbuckling behavior and nonconservative loading are also presented. Details pertaining to the implementation of the present formulation are also discussed.},

If there is an excess of the light component, spontaneous instability produces stationary, irregular wrinkles on the flame front, and the flame continues to propagate in a laminar regime.

  abstract = {We present the dynamic formulations for sliding beams that are deployed or retrieved through prismatic joints. The beams can undergo large deformation, large overall motion, with shear deformation accounted for. Until recently, the sliding beam problem has been tackled mostly under small deformation assumptions, or under quasi-static motion. Here we employ geometrically-exact beam theory. Two theoretically-equivalent formulations are proposed: A full Lagrangian version, and an Eulerian-Lagrangian version. A salient feature of the problem is that the equations of motion in both formulations are defined on time-varying spatial domain. This feature raises some complications in the computational formulation and computer implementation. We discuss in detail the transformation of the equations in the full Lagrangian formulation from a time-varying spatial domain to a constant spatial domain via the introduction of a stretched coordinate. A Galerkin projection is then applied to discretize the resulting governing partial differential equations. Even though the system does not have any rotating motion as in gyroscopic systems, the inertia operator has a weak form that can be decomposed exactly into a symmetric part and an anti-symmetric part. The distinction between the full Lagrangian formulation and the Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation from the computer implementation viewpoint is indicated. Several numerical examples - `spaghetti/reverse spaghetti problem,' beam under combined sliding motion and large angle maneuver, parametric resonance - are given to illustrate the versatility of the proposed approach. The results reveal a rich dynamical behavior to be explored further in the future.},

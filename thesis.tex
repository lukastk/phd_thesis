\abstract{%

The matter of this thesis is divided in two parts, both of which of are substantially different from the other, but nevertheless belong to disciplines that lie within the purview soft matter physics.

In the first part, we study the infinite-dimensional probability space of stochastic differential equations. In particular, we study the transition path ensemble (TPE), the set of transition paths between meta-stable states of It\^{o} diffusions. In the limit of vanishing diffusivity, the Freidlin-Wentzell action characterises the asymptotic character of the path-probability distribution over the TPE. We develop spectral Ritz methods to efficiently find minimisers of this action, and to construct quasipotentials of steady-state distributions, and we test our algorithm on a number of benchmark systems. To study the TPE in the finite temperature regime, we develop an MCMC algorithm to sample the infinite-dimensional space of transition paths, which we call the \textit{teleporter MCMC}. The algorithm was designed to efficiently sample the TPEs of It\^{o} diffusions with multiple competing transition channels, avoiding the issue of slow-mixing common to MCMC schemes. We concluded this part of the thesis by applying our MCMC method to study the temperature-dependence of the TPE. Using two model systems, we show that the dominant transition channel does not in general coincide with the most probable path of the path distribution, even in a low-to-intermediate temperature regime.

In the second part of this thesis we develop a general theory of the geometric mechanics of a broad class of microstructured continuum systems. Specifically, we consider systems with configuration spaces that are either Lie groups, or homogeneous spaces. We demonstrate that this theory, which we call a generalised geometric Cosserat theory (GGCT), can be seen as a unifying framework with which to study classical Cosserat systems, and numerous non-classical variations. As a paradigmatic example we first study the Cosserat rod model, we identify its configuration space as a curve in $SE(3)$, the Lie group of translations and rotations on Euclidean space, and use the Lie algebra-Lie group correspondence to relate its configuration to curves in the Lie algebra. Using the Euler-Poincar\'e theorem we then proceeded to formulate the dynamics of the Cosserat rod on the dual Lie algebra. The resulting kinodynamical - kinematic and dynamic - theory of the Cosserat rod is defined completely on the trivialisation of the tangent bundle of $SE(3)$, the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$. We then constructed the GGCT by extrapolating these above steps to systems with generalised configuration spaces. In the final chapter of this thesis, we constructed geometric numerical integrators designed to preserve the qualitative features of the system geometry.

\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

This thesis explores two distinct topics. The first part concerns itself with the study of transition events in stochastic differential equations, both in regimes where these are ubiquitous as well as rare. The second part develops a geometrical theory of Cosserat materials \citep{cosseratTheoryDeformableBodies1909}, and further a generalised framework for studying continuum systems with configurations taking value in Lie groups or homogeneous spaces. Whilst substantially different, the two parts of this thesis do share a common trait in that they explore the geometry of spaces that possess an infinite-dimensional character. In essence, the research we present in the first part of the thesis quantitatively and qualitatively investigates the concentration of path-probability measures, defined over the infinite-dimensional space of stochastic transition paths. In the second part of this thesis, we consider systems with infinite degrees-of-freedom; that is, the systems are Lie group-valued \textit{manifolds} and we construct a general kinematic and dynamical theory of such systems in terms of their intrinsic geometry. Below we will separately introduce the two parts of this thesis.

\section*{\large Global methods for sampling rare diffusive events}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Global methods for sampling rare diffusive events}

Randomness is important on all scales in nature, and is ubiquitous in the mesoscopic scales of soft matter physics. Rich phenomena in physical, chemical and biological systems often emerge out of the interplay between stochastic and deterministic forces, as for example in the nucleation of solids, the conformational changes in biomolecules, or shifts in ecological balance \citep{faccioliDominantPathwaysProtein2006a, demarcoPhaseTransitionModel2001a, gardnerConstructionGeneticToggle2000a, mangelBarrierTransitionsDriven1994a, wolynesNavigatingFoldingRoutes1995a, huangMolecularMathematicalBasis2012a, paninskiMostLikelyVoltage2006a, noltingBallsCupsQuasipotentials2016a, leeFindingMultipleReaction2017a}. Mathematically, many systems of this kind can be modelled as overdamped Langevin dynamics, otherwise known as It\^{o} diffusions \citep{kampenStochasticProcessesPhysics2011a, gardinerStochasticMethodsHandbook2010a, riskenFokkerPlanckEquationMethods2012a, bharucha-reidElementsTheoryMarkov2012a}. The stochastic trajectories of such random processes tend to concentrate around attractors of the dynamics in state-space, determined by the drift-field, which for gradient dynamics correspond to energetic minima. The influence of the stochastic forces renders the otherwise stable fixed points meta-stable, such that transitions between points or regions of meta-stability have finite probability. The set of all such transition paths between given meta-stable states is known as the transition path ensemble (TPE) \citep{bolhuisTransitionPathSampling2002a}. In Langevin models, the configuration of the system is often a reaction coordinate, and the characteristic pathways and rate constants of transition events are the main object of study \citep{dellagoCalculationReactionRate1999a, arjunUnbiasedAtomisticInsight2019, geisslerAutoionizationLiquidWater2001, carterConstrainedReactionCoordinate1989, laioEscapingFreeenergyMinima2002, bestMicroscopicInterpretationFolding2016, arjunUnbiasedAtomisticInsight2019}.

However transition events often occur on time-scales much larger than those of the dynamics itself \citep{petersReactionRateTheory2017, bolhuisTransitionPathSamplinga, grafkeLongTermEffects2017}. For example, the molecular dynamics of proteins are orders of magnitude smaller than the time-scale under which it unfolds \citep{veitshansProteinFoldingKinetics1997a}. In other words, transitions are \textit{rare events} for many relevant systems. Where analytical methods are intractable, numerical methods must be used to sample the transition path ensemble. However, it is in general not feasible to sample the TPE using standard stochastic integrators or molecular dynamics simulatons, due to the disparate time-scales of the target sample space and the dynamics. The study of the TPE must be approached via other means.

One such method is through the large deviation theory of Freidlin, Wentzell and Graham \citep{wentzellSmallRandomPerturbations1970, graham1987macroscopic}, which studies the TPE in the limit of vanishing noise, the so-called \textit{Freidlin-Wentzell limit}. The exponential scaling of transition rates in the noise-strength parameter can then be estimated by finding the global minimiser of an action functional. This minimiser, known as the \textit{instanton}, is the `least unlikely` pathway that the system will take in transition events, and any deviation from this path is exponentially suppressed in probability. However the limit of vanishing noise is unrealistic for many real physical systems, and some qualitative features of the transition paths may only emerge at finite temperatures \cite{pinskiTransitionPathsMolecules2010b}. In these regimes, sampling techniques must be used to sample the functional probability distribution over the TPE. Prominent examples of sampling methods are the \textit{transition path sampling} (TPS) \citep{dellagoTransitionPathSampling1998a, dellagoCalculationReactionRate1999a, dellagoEfficientTransitionPath1998, bolhuisTransitionPathSamplinga, bolhuisTransitionPathSampling2002a} and \textit{forward flux sampling} (FFS) \citep{escobedoTransitionPathSampling2009, allenForwardFluxSamplingtype2006, hussainStudyingRareEvents2020}. % Could add some stuff about the challenge of sampling multiple transiiton pathways.

In this first part of the thesis we offer some contributions to the study of the transition path ensemble of general overdamped Langevin systems, in both the Freidlin-Wentzell limit and at finite temperatures. In Ch.~\ref{ch:Ritz methods for Freidlin-Wentzel-Graham actions} we develop global methods of numerically minimising action functionals. The resulting method can be used to compute the \textit{quasi-potential} of general overdamped Langevin equations, which is a WKB-approximation of its steady-state distribution \citep{graham1987macroscopic, maier1996scaling, ludwig1975persistence}, as well the Freidlin-Wentzell instanton. 

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Monte Carlo methods in Path Spaces} we move on to consider transition path ensembles at finite temperatures. We begin with a survey of recent developments in the field of functional MCMC methods. We explain in detail the \textit{preconditioned Nicolson-Crank} algorithm \citep{cotterMCMCMethodsFunctions2013a, beskosMCMCMETHODSDIFFUSION2008a, hairerAnalysisSPDEsArising2005a, hairerAnalysisSPDEsArising2007a, hairerSpectralGapsMetropolis2014a}, which is an instance of an infinite-dimensional MCMC scheme. We apply this method to sample the TPE by expanding stochastic trajectories in the \textit{Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\`eve} basis \citep{kosambiParallelismPathspaces2016, karhunenUeberLineareMethoden1947, loeveProbabilityTheory1977a} of the corresponding drift-less free diffusion system, which is a method by which Gaussian stochastic processes can be expressed in terms of an infinite series of independent Gaussian random numbers. In doing so, we find that the spectrum of - \textit{non-Gaussian} - Langevin processes possess a band-structure, where only the lower-frequency band have non-trivial statistics; that is, the infinite-dimensional space of stochastic transition paths, of a general overdamped Langevin system, admits an \textit{effective} finite-dimensionalisation. We utilised this band-separation to modify and improve the autocorrelation times of the pCN. The main result of this chapter is the construction of the \textit{teleporter MCMC} (TMC), which is a combination of the pCN method and a set of independence samplers. The latter are constructed, using a semi-classical expansion of the path-probability distribution around the locally most-probable paths of the TPE. This in turn allows the MCMC to `teleport' between dominant transition channels. The teleporter MCMC was designed to deal with the issue of \textit{slow mixing} \citep{holdenMixingMCMCAlgorithms2019}, which is a common problem faced by MCMC methods that sample target distributions where the local maxima lack mutual support in the sample space. In the context of transition paths, we have that methods like the pCN will in general fail to mix between multiple transition channels in a single run, thus generating a biased sample. The TMC circumvents this problem by allowing the Markov chain to intermittently teleport between the transition channels, using the independence samplers. Finally, a section in this chapter is also dedicated to discuss the relation between the mathematical notion of a path-probability measure (or \textit{law}), and the infinite-dimensional path-probability densities (and path integrals) which are ubiquitous in physics. We show that the latter, which are often understood by mathematicians and physicists alike to be of dubious mathematical rigour, can be recontextualised and even be made rigorous by understanding how they relate to well-defined mathematical objects.

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Diffusivity dependence of transition paths}, the final chapter of this part of the thesis, we apply and extend the methods of the previous chapter to study the concentration of competing transition channels in the TPE, as a function of temperature. Using two model systems, we show that the dominant transition channel does not in general coincide with the most probable path of the path distribution, even in a low-to-intermediate temperature regime. We construct a semi-analytical approximation of the TPE as mixture of Gaussian measures using the semi-classical expansion of the path-probability distribution. We then apply this approximate probability measure to estimate the relative probability of competing transition channels. We verify the validity of these estimators using the MCMC methods developed in the previous chapter. We also demonstrate, using the model systems, that the interplay between fluctuations and drift can lead to the unintuitive result of energetically unfavourable transition channels dominating over the energetically favourable channels.

\section*{\large Geometric mechanics of microstructured soft matter}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Geometric mechanics of microstructured soft matter}

Solids and liquids are generally viewed from a macroscopic perspective as continuous materials that can continuously deform in time. In \textit{infinitesimal strain theory} \citep{landauTheoryElasticityVolume1986}, the deformations are assumed small enough to not significantly affect the overall shape. However, this assumption does not hold soft matter materials, that are often highly deformable \citep{volokhMechanicsSoftMaterials2019}. Furthermore, beyond the spatial extension of the continuum body, many systems relevant to soft matter physics \citep{krishnaswamyCosserattypeModelRed1996, rangamaniSmallScaleMembrane2014, sackBiologicalTissueMechanics2016, zhangModelingSimulationComplex2019, corazzaUnravelingLoopingEfficiency2022} also have internal degrees of freedom, which we call \textit{microstructure}. The classical account of microstructured continuum mechanics was given in the seminal work of the Cosserat brothers \cite{cosseratTheoryDeformableBodies1909} in 1909. There, they introduced the notion of a what is now called a \textit{Cosserat material}: A continuum body $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{E}^3$, where there are $n$ deformable vectors, known as \textit{directors}, attached at each point $p \in \mathcal{M}$. For such systems, they derived the mechanical equation of motion of the spatial continuum body $\mathcal{M}$ as well as the $n$ director-fields on $\mathcal{M}$. This formalism is applicable to many physical systems. The shell of a cell membranes can be modelled as a mid-surface in Euclidean space, with a single director that point towards and away from the inner and outer shell boundaries respectively \citep{krishnaswamyCosserattypeModelRed1996, rangamaniSmallScaleMembrane2014}. The corresponding one-dimensional model is the Cosserat rod, which consists of a center-line curve and two director fields representing the deformation of its cross-section. Such models are prominently used in soft robotics \citep{rendaDiscreteCosseratApproach2018, graziosoGeometricallyExactModel2019, rendaDiscreteCosseratApproach2016, caasenbroodEnergyShapingControllersSoft2022, boyerMacrocontinuousComputedTorque2006, boyerMacrocontinuousDynamicsHyperredundant2012, rendaDynamicModelMultibending2014, verlSoftRoboticsTransferring2015, naughtonElasticaCompliantMechanics2021}, the modelling of muscles and ligaments \citep{sackBiologicalTissueMechanics2016, zhangModelingSimulationComplex2019}, and three-dimensional Cosserat models are frequently used in material science \citep{stefanouCosseratApproachLocalization2017,
forestCosseratModellingSize2000,
altenbachCosseratMedia2013,
ebrahimianNumericalStudyInterface2021,
mohanFrictionalCosseratModel1999,
koteraCosseratContinuumTheory2000,
stefanouThreedimensionalCosseratHomogenization2008,
onckCosseratModelingCellular2002,
iesanDeformationPorousCosserat2011}. There are also many examples in nature of active filaments \citep{moultonElasticSecretsChameleon2016, oliveriTheoryDurotacticAxon2021, kierTonguesTentaclesTrunks1985, moultonMultiscaleIntegrationEnvironmental2020}, which are slender rods \citep{kirchhoffUeberGleichgewichtUnd1859, dillKirchhoffTheoryRods1992, gorielyNonlinearDynamicsFilaments2000} that have internal configurations \citep{kaczmarskiActiveFilamentsCurvature2022}.

In contrast to rigid bodies, which we can only subject to external forcing, a continuum system admits the notion of a \textit{stress}. That is, the dynamics of continua are \textit{constitutive}, and force fields that arise due to internal stresses are functions not of the deformations themselves, but its rate-of-change. For continua without microstructure, connections can be made between continuum mechanics and standard concepts in Riemannian geometry. For example, the rate of deformation can be related to a Lie derivative of the Riemannian metric \citep{marsdenMathematicalFoundationsElasticity1994}. As the relevant dynamical quantities for constitutive continuum mechanics are defined in terms the derivatives of their deformations, it may be convenient to parameterise its mechanics in terms of its intrinsic geometry. An extensive literature on such geometrisations exist for the case of systems without microstructure \citep{marsdenMathematicalFoundationsElasticity1994, wangIntroductionRationalElasticity1973, wangGeometricStructuresSimple1967, greenMechanicsNonlinearMaterials1957, lublinerMethodVirtualPower, nollMathematicalTheoryMechanical1958}. Though Cosserat theory, and microstructured models in general, are used widely, there is no extensive literature on equivalent geometrised theories for such systems. In \citep{yamaokaContinuumDynamicsVector2010} a formulation analogous to the Riemannian approach applied to Cosserat media, using a vector bundle construction.

However there is a more natural geometrical formulation for Cosserat materials. Namely, we can identify a \textit{Lie group structure} in their kinematic configuration spaces. Such approaches have been exemplified previously in \citep{giusteriSimulationViscoelasticCosserat2021, giusteriImportanceEffectivenessRepresenting, chirikjianStochasticElasticaExcludedVolume2008, holmMatrixGstrands2014}. There, a Cosserat rod with a rigid-body cross-section was kinematically parameterised as a curve in $SE(3)$, the Lie group of translations and rotations on three-dimensional Euclidean space. This formulation naturally lends itself to formulating the kinematics and dynamics, which we will abbreviate as \textit{kinodynamics} \citep{donaldKinodynamicMotionPlanning1993, donaldProvablyGoodApproximation1995} henceforth, in terms of the corresponding \textit{Lie algebra} $\mathfrak{se}(3)$, using the Lie group-Lie algebra correspondence. The resulting kinodynamic equations of motion encapsulate the intrinsic geometry of both the external and internal degrees of freedom of the Cosserat rod.

In the second part of this thesis, we will construct a general theory of the geometric mechanics of a broad class of microstructured continuum systems. Specifically, we will consider continua with configuration spaces that are Lie groups, as well as \textit{homogeneous spaces}\footnote{See Sec.~\ref{sec:Mathematical preliminaries} for a definition.}. We call these \textit{generalised Cosserat systems}, and we will refer to our theoretical study of this class of systems as a \textit{generalised geometric Cosserat theory} (GGCT). This class encompasses and goes beyond the entire suite of possible Cosserat models. Mathematically, we will show that the GGCT can be seen as a field theory, defined on arbitrary topological base manifolds, and takes values in general Lie groups or homogeneous spaces. The kinodynamic formulation of these fields are then derived in terms of the Lie algebraic structure of their configuration spaces. In numerical simulations, the benefit of our geometric approach is that constitutive dynamics can now be formulated without the need of triangulating the configurational manifold of the system, otherwise known as finite-element methods (FEM) \citep{hughesFiniteElementMethod2012}. 

In Ch.~\ref{sec:geometry introduction} we will introduce the classical theory of Cosserat materials. In particular, we focus on the Cosserat rod, which we will treat carefully in the subsequent chapter. We will also introduce the necessary mathematical formalism required for the GGCT. These mathematical preliminaries will also serve as an introduction to the theory of sub-manifolds of Lie groups and homogeneous spaces.

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Cosserat rods} we study in detail the Cosserat rod and the filament, the corresponding non-microstructured system. As in \citep{giusteriSimulationViscoelasticCosserat2021, giusteriImportanceEffectivenessRepresenting, chirikjianStochasticElasticaExcludedVolume2008, holmMatrixGstrands2014}, we parameterise the Cosserat rod as a curve in $SE(3)$, and use the Lie group-Lie algebra map to construct a corresponding curve in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$. We also provide additional mathematical context, identifying the Lie algebraic kinematic configuration as the \textit{Maurer-Cartan form} (MC), a Lie algebra-valued $1$-form. The kinematic equations of motion are then found as a result of the \textit{Maurer-Cartan equations}, which enforce the integrability of the MC form. We then derive the conservative and constitutive dynamics of the Cosserat rod using the \textit{Euler-Poincar\'e theorem} \citep{marsdenIntroductionMechanicsSymmetry2013, marleHenriPoincareNote2013a}. By constructing a generalised Lagrange-D'Alembert principle, we then derive generalised non-conservative dynamics. We will conceptualise the filament as a kinematically constrained Cosserat rod, analogous to forming a homogeneous space from the quotient $G/H$, of a Lie group $G$ and a Lie subgroup $H \subset G$. Drawing on the methods already developed for the Cosserat rod, we then derive the full kinodynamic equations of motion of the filament. In addition to the geometrised theory we provide here, we will also derive and specify some physical models as applications of our theory.

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Geometric continuum mechanics on homogeneous configuration spaces} we present and derive (in that order) the generalised geometric Cosserat theory. The theory is largely constructed analogously as a generalisation of the treatment in Ch.~\ref{ch:Cosserat rods}, and conceptually we use the Cosserat rod and filament as an pedagogical device to understand generalised Cosserat systems with Lie group- and homogeneous configuration spaces respectively. We conclude this chapter with a chapter on applications of the GGCT. We considered the classical cases of the Cosserat rod, surface and body, as well as Cosserat rod on spheres and Minkowski space. To illustrate the connection between the GGCT and field theories, we also applied it to study the $O(n)$ non-linear $\sigma$ field theory (NLSM) \citep{ketovQuantumNonlinearSigmaModels2013}. Using our example systems, we aim to demonstrate the generality of the programme, but also emphasise the its relative ease-of-use. 

Finally, in Ch.~\ref{ch:Geometric numerical integrators} we refine the GGCT for numerical applications. We begin by observing that the right-hand sides of the kinodynamic equations of motion can be identified as a Lie algebra action on itself. This allows us to formulate \textit{geometric integrators}, designed to qualitatively preserve geometric features in numerical simulations. We contextualise our work as an application of \textit{Lie group integration} theory  \citep{celledoniIntroductionLieGroup2014c, owrenLieGroupIntegrators2016, iserlesLiegroupMethods2005, celledoniLieGroupIntegrators2022a}, applied in the infinite-dimensional setting of continuum systems. We apply our geometric integrators to show that they successfully outperform standard PDE integrators in preserving the geometric features of the system.

\chapter*{Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Summary}
 
The research presented in this thesis divides into two parts. In the first part, we studied and developed methods for studying the transition path ensemble of It\^{o} diffusion equations. In the second part, we developed a geometric theory of continuum mechanics of systems with Lie group- or homogeneous configuration spaces. Below we summarise the main results of each chapter of the two research streams discussed in this thesis.


In Ch.~\ref{ch:Ritz methods for Freidlin-Wentzel-Graham actions} we began our exploration of the transition path ensemble by considering the Freidlin-Wentzell limit, which corresponds to a limit of vanishing diffusivity. We presented numerical methods for computing most probable transition paths and quasi-potentials of general It\^{o} diffusion equations with additive noise. The method directly minimises the Freidlin-Wentzell action, which allowed for flexibility in choosing the path parametrisation. It uses numerical quadrature to reduce the action to a multivariate function, whose minimum is obtained by either gradient-free and gradient-based optimisation. This provides both the minimum action path and quasipotential. The direct method consisted of a discretisation of the Freidlin-Wentzell action, followed by a search for the minimum in the resulting finite-dimensional space. This approach is algorithmically simple and we showed its accuracy and efficiency on a number of benchmark problems.

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Monte Carlo methods in Path Spaces} we considered the TPE at finite temperatures. We applied recent mathematical developments in the field of functional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to the sampling of stochastic transition pathways. On this foundation, we developed an MCMC scheme designed to sample TPEs with multiple competing transition channels, which we called the teleporter MCMC. The method was based on a semi-classical expansion of the path-probability measure around the dominant transition pahs of the distribution, with which we constructed independence samplers allowing for the MCMC to intermittently `teleport' between transition channels. Akin to the Ritz method of the Ch.~\ref{ch:Ritz methods for Freidlin-Wentzel-Graham actions}, the MCMC procedures were discretised using a global spectral basis. Speficially, we expanded stochastic paths in the Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\`eve of the Brownian bridge process. We showed that spectrum of modes in this expansion can be separated into high- and low-frequency bands, where only the lower-band modes are non-trivially distributed, whilst the statistics of the latter is indistinguishable from that of free diffusion. Future research directions may involve devising multi-level MCMC schemes designed around band-structure of the KKL-based methods we developed in this chapter. Furthermore, we may consider extending the algorithm to sample transition path ensembles of field theories. 

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Diffusivity dependence of transition paths} we studied the concentration of competing transition channels in the transition path ensemble, as a function of diffusivity. Using two model systems, we showed that the dominant transition channel does not in general coincide with most probable paths of the path measure, even in a low-to-intermediate temperature regime. We approximated the TPE as mixed Gaussian measures using the semi-classical expansions developed in the previous chapter, using which we constructed semi-analytical approximators of channel rate probabilities. In the regime of validity of these approximators, we showed that the relative dominance of transition channels is a conspiracy between the path-probability of the instanton, reflecting the energetic cost of transition, and Gaussian normalisation constants, reflecting the fluctuations around the instanton.

In Ch.~\ref{sec:geometry introduction} we began our study of the geometric continuum mechanics of systems with Lie group- or homogeneous configuration spaces. We reviewed the classical theories that our work builds on, and developed the necessary mathematical tools for the results of the subsequent chapters. Of these, the mathematical preliminaries, though dense, by itself foreshadows and serves as a dry-run for the geometrical treatment that was to come.

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Cosserat rods} we derived the kinematic and dynamic - in short, kinodynamic - equations of Cosserat rods and filaments. These were chosen as paradigmatic examples of systems with Lie group- and homogeneous configuration spaces, and served as a foundation for the generalisations of the chapter that followed. We identified the configuration space of the Cosserat rod as the special Euclidean group $SE(3)$, and used the Euler-Poincaré theorem to find conservative force and moment balance equations. Furthermore, we constructed a generalised Lagrange-D'Alembert principle from which arbitrary non-conservative dynamics can be derived, and expressed the resulting kinodynamic equations of motion in terms of a spatial reconstruction field $X$ and generalised momentum field $S$, which are defined on the Lie algebra and its dual respectively. This Lie algebraic formulation was shown to naturally lead to kinodynamics expressed in terms of the intrinsic geometry of the rod. We then studied the filament model, which we devised as a Cosserat rod subject to kinematic constraints, and found its kinodynamic equations of motion. We thus demonstrated how systems with homogeneous configuration spaces can be obtained by imposing kinematic constraints on Lie group-configured systems.

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Geometric continuum mechanics on homogeneous configuration spaces} we studied generalised Cosserat systems, which we defined as continuum bodies with a material base of general topology, and Lie group- or homogeneous configuration spaces. We formulated a general theory of the kinodynamics of such systems, which we called a generalised geometric Cosserat theory (GGCT). The cornerstone of the programme was to use the exponential map to relate the spatio-temporal configuraiton of the system to Lie algebra-valued reconstruction fields. This allowed us to express the kinodynamics of generalised Cosserat systems directly in terms of its intrinsic geometry. We applied the GGCT to derive the kinodynamic equations of motion for a variety of known and new systems, which included the classical suite of Cosserat surfaces and bodies, Cosserat rods on spheres and in Minkowski space, as well as an application for non-linear $\sigma$ field theory.

In Ch.~\ref{ch:Geometric numerical integrators} we developed geometric integrators for generalised Cosserat systems. We saw this as an application of Lie group integration theory to the infinite-dimensional setting of continuum systems. We demonstrated that our integrators preserve spatial integrability using the example of a Cosserat surface, and compared their performance to standard non-geometrical numeric integrators. We also showed that other qualitative features, like the closure of a rod, are preserved by our integrators.

\chapter{MCMC benchmark models} \label{app:MCMC benchmark models}

Here we define the Langevin model systems considered in Ch.~\ref{ch:Monte Carlo methods in Path Spaces} and Ch.~\ref{ch:Diffusivity dependence of transition paths}. We begin by defining a non-dimensionalised formulation of the Langevin equation with additive noise
\begin{equation}
d\mathbf{X}=\mu\mathbf{F}dt+\sqrt{2D}d\mathbf{W}.
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the mobility constant and $D$ the diffusion constant. We write the latter as $D = \mu k_B \theta$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant $\theta$ is the temperature. We assume that the force is the gradient of a potential energy function $U : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$  as $\mathbf{F} = - \nabla \cdot U$.

Let $T_{0}=\frac{L^{2}}{k_{B}\theta_{0}\mu}$ be a time-scale, $\theta_{0}$ a temperature-scale, and $L_0$ a characteristic length-scale of the potential. We set $t=T_{0}\tilde{t}$,
$\theta=\theta_{0}\tilde{\theta}$, $\mathbf{X}=L_0 \tilde{\mathbf{X}}$,
$\mathbf{F}= \frac{\tilde{U}_0}{L_0} \tilde{\mathbf{F}}$ and $\mathbf{W}=\sqrt{T_{0}}\tilde{\mathbf{W}}$. $T_{0}$ is the typical diffusion time-scale at temperature $\theta_{0}$. We get
\begin{equation}
	d\mathbf{\tilde{X}}=\tilde{U}_{0} \tilde{\mathbf{F}}d\tilde{t}+\sqrt{2\tilde{\theta}}d\tilde{\mathbf{W}}.
\end{equation}
where all quantities in the equation are now non-dimensional, and where $\tilde{U}_{0}=\frac{U_{0}}{k_{B}\theta_{0}}$ is the ratio
of the energetic well-depth $U_{0}$ and the thermal energy at temperature $\theta_{0}$. We set $\tilde{U}_0 = 1$, such that $\theta = \theta_0$ corresponds to the temperature at which $U_0 = k_B \theta_0$. In other words, the characteristic energy scale of the potential is equal to the thermal energy at temperature $\theta_0$. Finally, the non-diemsionalised Langevin equation is
\begin{equation}
	d\mathbf{\tilde{X}}= \tilde{\mathbf{F}}d\tilde{t}+\sqrt{2\tilde{\theta}}d\tilde{\mathbf{W}}.
\end{equation}

\section{The asymmetric double-well system} \label{app:The asymmetric double-well system}

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs_part1/mcmc/1D_process_potential}
\centering \caption{The asymmetric double-well potential, with minima at $x/L_0 = -1$ (hollow red circle) and $x/L_0=1$ (filled red circle). See App.~\ref{app:The asymmetric double-well system} for its definition.}
\label{fig:1D process potential} 
\end{figure}

Consider a $1$-dimensional Langevin system with a quartic potential
\begin{equation} \label{eq:general quartic potential}
	U(x) = U_0 \left( 1 + a \frac{x}{L_0} + b \left( \frac{x}{L_0} \right)^2 + x \left( \frac{x}{L_0} \right)^3  + d \left( \frac{x}{L_0} \right)^4  \right).
\end{equation}
We impose the following conditions
\begin{enumerate}
\item $U'(-L_0) = U'(L_0) = 0$. Extrema at $x = -L_0$ and $x= L_0$.
\item $U(-L_0) = 0$ and $U(L_0) = \Delta U$. The energy cost of moving from the left-most extremum to the right-most extremum is $\Delta U$.
\end{enumerate}
Imposing the conditions on Eq.\ref{eq:general quartic potential}, we get
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:asymmetric double well}
U(x)= \left( \left(\frac{x}{L_0}-1\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{4}\frac{\Delta U}{U_{0}}\left(\frac{x}{L_0}-2\right)\right)\left(\frac{x}{L_0}+1\right)^{2}. 
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:asymmetric double well} defines an \textit{asymmetric} variant of a standard quartic double-well system, with minimii at $\frac{x}{L_0}= -1$ and $\frac{x}{L_0}=1$, and a maximum at $\frac{x}{L_0} = \frac{ 3 \Delta U}{16 U_0}$. See Fig.~\ref{fig:1D process potential} for a depiction of the potential energy landscape. In non-dimensionalised form, the potential is
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:asymmetric double well nondim}
\tilde{U}(\tilde{x})= \left( \tilde{x}-1\right)^{2} - \frac{1}{4} \frac{\Delta U}{U_{0}} \left( \tilde{x}-2 \right) \left(\tilde{x}+1\right)^{2}. 
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{x} = x / L$. In all numerical simulations, we have set $\frac{\Delta U}{U_{0}}=1/2$.

\section{The switch system} \label{app:The switch system}

Here we define the \textit{switch} system, and its non-conservative variant used in Ch.~\ref{ch:Diffusivity dependence of transition paths}. We consider a $2$-dimensional Langevin system with a Sombrero-type potential $U : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$. Let $\Gamma=\{(x,y)\ |\ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} =1\}$ be the circle centred around the origin, and let $\Gamma^{+}$ and
$\Gamma^{-}$ signify the upper and lower semi-circle respectively. We will a construct the potential such that $\Gamma$ coincides with a manifold of potential minima, and such that the perpendicular curvature of the potential along $\Gamma^{+}$ is larger than along $\Gamma^{-}$. We
start with a radial quartic potential of the form 
\begin{align}
U(x_{1},x_{2}) & =U_{r}(r(x_{1},x_{2}))\\
U_{r}(r) & =U_{0}\left(\frac{r}{L_0}-1\right)\left(1+a\frac{r}{L_0}+b\left(\frac{r}{L_0}\right)^{2}+c\left(\frac{r}{L_0}\right)^{3}\right)\nonumber 
\end{align}
where $L_0$ is the length-scale of the system, $U_{0}$ will be the
value of the potential at the local maximum $r=0$, and $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}$
will be specified below. We will henceforth suppress the argument of
the radial coordinate function $r(x_{1},x_{2})=\sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}}$. We
impose the following conditions on the potential to fix $a, b$ and $c$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $U_r'(0) = 0$. The origin is an extremum.
\item $U_r'(L_0) = 0$. $\Gamma$ is an extremum of the potential.
\item $U_r''(L_0) = k$. The curvature along $\Gamma$ is $k$.
\end{enumerate}
We get
\begin{equation}
U_{r}(r)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{r}{L_0}-1\right)^{2}\left[L_0^{2} k \left(\frac{r}{L_0}\right)^{2}-2U_{0}\left(\frac{r}{L_0}-1\right)\left(3\frac{r}{L_0}+1\right)\right]
\end{equation}
which is, in the non-dimensionalised form
\begin{equation}
\tilde{U}_{r}(\tilde{r})= \frac{1}{2} 
\left( \tilde{r} -1 \right)^{2} \left[L_0^{2} \tilde{k} \tilde{r}^{2}-2  
\left(\tilde{r}-1\right)\left(3\tilde{r}+1\right)\right].
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{r} = r / L$ and $\tilde{k} = \frac{k}{U_0}$. In order to ensure that the potential has a Sombrero-like form, we
must further have that the potential is confining, which is equivalent
to $\underset{r\to\infty}{\lim}U_{r}(r)=\infty$, which implies that
$6U_{0}\leq L_0^{2}k$. We now introduce an angular dependence in the
curvature. We set
\begin{equation}
L_0^{2}k(\phi)=6U_{0}(1+2h(\phi))\label{eq:curvature}
\end{equation}
where $\phi=\phi(x_{1},x_{2})$ is the angle of $(x_{1},x_{2})$ in
polar coordinates so that $x_{1}=\cos(\phi)$, $x_{2}=\sin(\phi)$,
and where
\begin{equation}
h(\phi)=\frac{1}{4}\left(\xi_{2}+\xi_{1}+(\xi_{2}-\xi_{1})\sin\phi\right)
\end{equation}
where $\xi_{2}>\xi_{1}$, and where $h(\phi)\in[\xi_{1},\xi_{2}]$
satisfies $h(-\pi/2)=\xi_{1}$ and $h(\pi/2)=\xi_{2}$. Eq.~\eqref{eq:curvature}
is constructed so that the perpendicular curvature of $\Gamma^{+}$
is larger than that of $\Gamma^{-}$. The drift of the system is now
given by $\mathbf{F}=-\nabla U$. This concludes the definition of the switch system.

We also consider a non-conservative variant of the switch system. We introduce an additional non-conservative
force $\mathbf{F}^{a}=-\eta\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ for which the
work done in a displacement $d\mathbf{x}=dr\hat{\mathbf{r}}+rd\phi\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$
is $dW=\mathbf{F}^{a}\cdot d\mathbf{x}=\eta rd\phi$. This force energetically
biases the upper transition channel $\Gamma^{+}$. The total force
is thus $\mathbf{F}=-\nabla U+\mathbf{F}^{a}$.

In the numerical experiments presented in the main text, we used the
Itô Langevin equation 
\begin{equation}
d\mathbf{X}=\mu\mathbf{F}dt+\sqrt{2\mu k_{B}\theta}d\mathbf{W}.\label{eq:langevin equation}
\end{equation}
For the numerical experiments in the main text  we use $\tilde{U}_{0}=1$,
which means that $\tilde{\theta}=1$ corresponds to a temperature
such that $k_{B}\theta=U_{0}$. We also set $\xi_{1}=0$ and $\xi_{2}=2$.
To compare the gradient force $-\nabla \cdot U$ with $\mathbf{F}^{a}$ we also introduce
$f_{\text{eq}}=U_{0}/L$, which is the characteristic force strength
of the gradient force.

\chapter{Calculating the regularised normalisation constants of infinite-dimensional Gaussian measures} \label{app:Calculation of the Gaussian normalisation constants}

The regularised normalisation constants of Gaussian measures defined on functional
spaces can be found by computing the determinants of their covariance
operators. Equivalently, they can be found by computing
the determinant of their precision operator, which is the inverse
of the covariance operator. As for finite-dimensional linear operators,
determinants of differential operators can be found by computing the product of their
eigenvalues, but as the numerical computation of the spectrum of a linear operator is expensive, this is in general not feasible in this setting. For a specific class of linear operators, their regularised normalisation constants can be computed using the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem (GYT) \citep{gelfandIntegrationFunctionalSpaces1960a, levitTheoremInfiniteProducts1977a, dunneFunctionalDeterminantsQuantum2008a}, by solving a system of ODEs. Here we will first recount the GYT, and then derive an extension of theorem that can be used for the precision operators of the semi-classical expansions of the laws of general It\^{o} processes with additive noise.

Let the linear operators
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(P\frac{d}{dt}\right)-R\label{eq:linear operator}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{0}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(P\frac{d}{dt}\right)\label{eq:free linear operator}
\end{equation}
be defined for $0\leq t\leq T$, and where $P(t)\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$
is a symmetric positive-definite matrix function and $R(t)\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$
is a symmetric matrix function. Let $\gamma^{(k)}$ and $\mathbf{u}^{(k)}(t;\alpha)$
be the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\mathcal{L}$, which are
solutions to the boundary value problem
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}\mathbf{u}^{(k)}(t)=\gamma^{(k)}\mathbf{u}^{(k)}(t)\label{eq:eigenfunction eq}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{u}^{(k)}(0)=\mathbf{u}^{(k)}(T)=0$. Similarly, let
$\mathbf{u}_{0}^{(k)}(t)$ and $\gamma_{0}^{(k)}$ be the eigenfunctions
and eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}_{0}$. Then the \emph{functional determinant}
of $\mathcal{L}$ is defined in regularised form as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\det\mathcal{L}}{\det\mathcal{L}_{0}}=\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\gamma^{(k)}}{\gamma_{0}^{(k)}}.\label{eq:functional determinant}
\end{equation}
As the spectrum of Eq.~\ref{eq:linear operator} is unknown, and
numerically expensive to compute, a much more efficient way of computing
Eq.~\ref{eq:functional determinant} is via the GYT.
The GYT states that the functional determinant can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\left|\frac{\det\mathcal{L}}{\det\mathcal{L}_{0}}\right|=\left|\frac{\det\left[Y(T)\right]}{\det\left[Y_{0}(T)\right]}\right|\label{eq:GY result}
\end{equation}
where $Y(t)\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times x}$ with components $Y_{ij}(t)=y_{i}^{(j)}(t)$,
where the $\mathbf{y}^{(j)}(t)$ are solutions to the $d$ second-order
ODEs with initial conditions
\begin{align} 
\mathcal{L}\mathbf{y}^{(j)}(t) & =0\label{eq:GY theorem}\\
\mathbf{y}^{(j)}(0) & =0\\
\frac{d}{dt}y_{i}^{(j)}(0) & =\delta_{ij}.
\end{align}
and where the matrix $Y_{0}(t)\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$
is defined similarly, but with $\mathcal{L}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:GY theorem}
replaced with $\mathcal{L}_{0}$. We now present a generalisation of the GYT that allows for linear operators of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:extended GYT form operator}
\mathcal{L}=\frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}}+U\frac{d}{dt}+R
\end{equation}
where $0\leq t\leq T$, and where $U(t),\ R(t)\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$
are anti-symmetric and symmetric matrix functions respectively. This extended GYT will make the theorem applicable to compute the regularised normalisation constants of the precision operators discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:Second-order variational expansions of stochastic action functionals}.

We define the linear operator $\mathcal{G}$ which acts on vector
functions as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:G op}
	\mathcal{G}\mathbf{y}=G\mathbf{y}
\end{equation}
where $G(t)$ is a matrix function that solves the equation
\begin{equation}
\dot{G}=-\frac{1}{2}UG.\label{eq:G eq}
\end{equation}
As $U(t)$ is anti-symmetric we have $U(t) \in \mathfrak{so}(d)$, where the latter is the Lie algebra of the special orthogonal group $SO(d)$. Then Eq.~\ref{eq:G eq} is the exponential mapping from the Lie algebra to the Lie group, therefore $G \in SO(d)$. We define the linear operator
\begin{equation} \label{eq:transformed linear operator}
\tilde{\mathcal{L}}=\mathcal{G}^{-1}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{G}=\frac{d}{dt^{2}}+G^{T}\left(R-\frac{1}{2}\dot{U}-\frac{1}{4}U^{2}\right)G
\end{equation}
where we have used $G^{-1} = G^T$. Equation \ref{eq:transformed linear operator} is of the form Eq.~\ref{eq:linear operator}, as the second term is a symmetric matrix, and we can therefore compute $\det\tilde{\mathcal{L}}$ using the GYT. As for any two operators $\mathcal{A}$
and $\mathcal{B}$, we have that $\det\mathcal{A\mathcal{B}}=\det\mathcal{A}\det\mathcal{B}$,
and $\det\mathcal{A}^{-1}=1/\det\mathcal{A}$, and we therefore have
that $\det\mathcal{L}=\det\tilde{\mathcal{L}}$. The functional determinant
$\det\mathcal{L}$ can thus be computed by first solving Eq.~\ref{eq:G eq}, and then
constructing $\tilde{\mathcal{L}}$ using Eq.~\ref{eq:transformed linear operator},
and finally using the GYT to compute $\det\tilde{\mathcal{L}}$.

The above can be applied to compute the regularised normalisation constants of the precision operators derived in Sec.~\ref{sec:Second-order variational expansions of stochastic action functionals}, which were the result the semi-classical approximations of the path measures of general It\^{o} diffusions with additive noise. The precision matrix is of the form
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{H}^{[\bar{\mathbf{x}}]} =-\frac{1}{D} \frac{d}{dt^{2}}+2A\frac{d}{dt}+B
\end{equation}
We can compute the regularised normalisation constant of $\mathcal{H}^{[\bar{\mathbf{x}}]}$ by letting $P(t)=-\frac{1}{D} \mathbbm{I}_{d}$, $U=-2 D A$ and $R=B$ and applying the extended GYT. In the case of gradient dynamics, when $A = 0$, the original GYT can be readily applied by using $P(t)=-\frac{1}{D} \mathbbm{I}_{d}$ and $R(t)=-B(t)$, where $\mathbbm{I}_{d}$ is the identity matrix.


\chapter{Reconstructing the spatio-temporal configuration} \label{app:Reconstructing the spatio-temporal configuration}

To reconstruct the spatio-temporal configuration $\Phi(t, \mathbf{u})$ of a system from its spatial reconstruction fields $X_\alpha(t, \mathbf{u})$ and generalised velocity field $N(t,\mathbf{u})$, where $\mathbf{u} \in M$, we must solve the equation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:app phi and xi gen}
	\Phi^{-1} d \Phi = \xi
\end{equation}
where $\xi = N dt + X_\alpha du^\alpha$. Given some initial condition $\Phi(\bar{t}, \mathbf{u}_0)$, we can find $\Phi(\bar{t},\mathbf{u})$ by integrating Eq.~\ref{eq:app phi and xi gen} for fixed $\bar{t}$ along some curve $\gamma : [0,1] \to M$ that satisfies $\gamma(0) = \mathbf{u}_0$ and $\gamma(1) = \mathbf{u}$. If $X_\alpha$ satisfy spatial integrability, the result of this integration is independent of the shape of the path $\gamma$.

A numerical scheme for reconstructing the spatio-temporal configuration can thus be devised by repeatedly integrating Eq.~\ref{eq:app phi and xi gen} along curves that trace out $\Phi$ along the desired points $\mathbf{u} \in M$. In the following section we will show such a scheme explicitly for the case of the Cosserat rod, and the procedure can be readily generalised to higher-dimensional systems.

\section{Numerical algorithm for reconstructing the Cosserat rod} \label{app:Reconstructing the Cosserat rod from xi}

Here we describe how to reconstruction the spatio-temporal configuration of a Cosserat rod $\Phi(t,u)$ from the spatial reconstruction field $X(t,u)$ and generalised velocity field $N(t,u)$. These are related as Eq.~\ref{eq:app phi and xi gen}, where $\xi = X du + N dt$, from which we have
\begin{subequations} 
\begin{align}
\Phi' & =  \Phi X \label{eq:F u} \\
\dot{\Phi} & = \Phi  N \label{eq:F t}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Formally, these have solutions
\begin{subequations} 
\begin{align}
\Phi_{ij}(u, \bar{t}) & = \Phi_{ik}(0, \bar{t}) \mathscr{U} \left\{ e^{ \int_0^u X(u, \bar{t}) du } \right\}_{kj} \\
\Phi_{ij}(\bar{u}, t) & = \Phi_{ik}(\bar{u}, 0) \mathscr{T} \left\{ e^{ \int_0^t N(\bar{u}, t) dt } \right\}_{kj}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathscr{U}(\cdot)$ and $\mathscr{T}(\cdot)$ signifies the spatial and temporal time-ordered integral respectively. Numerically, these can be efficiently approximated by discretisation, and incrementally solved using the \textit{Magnus expansion} \citep{magnusExponentialSolutionDifferential1954}. Eq. \ref{eq:F u} and Eq. \ref{eq:F t}
can therefore be used together to trace out $\mathcal{F}$
from a single initial condition $\Phi(u_{0}, t_{0})$. Due to
the integrability of $\xi$, the value $\Phi(t, u)$ at $(t, u)$ is invariant with respect to which particular path
in $(t, u)$-space is taken. In light of this there are theoretically
an infinite number of reconstruction schemes. Below we propose what
we find to be the most convenient reconstruction scheme.

We discretise time and space as $u_{\alpha}=\alpha\Delta u,\ \alpha=0,\dots,N_{u}$, such that $u_{0}=t_{0}=0$ and $t_{\beta}=\beta\Delta t,\ \beta=0,\dots,N_{t}$
and $u_{N_{u}}=L_{0}$ and $t_{N_{t}}=T$. We define $\Phi^{\alpha,\beta}\approx \Phi(\alpha\Delta u,\beta\Delta t)$,
$X^{\alpha,\beta}\approx X(\alpha\Delta u,\beta\Delta t)$ and $Y^{\alpha,k}\approx Y(\alpha\Delta u,\beta\Delta t)$.
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:numerical schema for reconstruction of Cosserat rod}
\begin{align}
\Phi_{ij}^{0, \beta+1} & = \Phi_{ik}^{0, \beta} \exp_{SE(3)} \left(\Delta t\ N^{0, \beta}\right)_{kj}, & \Phi^{0,0}=\Phi^{(i)}\\
\Phi_{ij}^{\alpha+1, \beta} & = \Phi_{ik}^{\alpha, \beta}\exp_{SE(3)}  \left(\Delta u\ X^{\alpha,\beta}\right)_{kj} \label{eq:F spatial numerical eq}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with the initial condition $\mathcal{F}^{0,0}=\mathcal{F}^{(i)}$.
The matrix exponential has a closed-form analytical formula given
by

\exp_{SE(3)}  (H)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & \vec{0}^{T}\\
\mathscr{B}(\hat{m}) \vec{v} & \exp_{SO(3)}(\hat{m})
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
for $H=\left\{ \vec{v};\vec{m}\right\} \in\mathfrak{se}(3)$ and
\begin{subequations} 
\begin{align}
\mathscr{B}(\hat{m}) & =\mathbbm{1}_{3}+\frac{1-\cos|\vec{m}|}{|\vec{m}|^{2}}\hat{m}+\frac{|\vec{m}|-\sin|\vec{m}|}{|\vec{m}|^{3}}\hat{m}^{2}\label{eq:A}\\

\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\exp_{SO(3)} (\hat{m}) \in SO(3)$ is an element of the special orthogonal
group in 3 dimensions. As Eq. \ref{eq:A} and Eq. \ref{eq:B} are
ill-conditioned for small $|\vec{m}|$, in numerics it is often prudent
to Taylor expand to at least $O(|\vec{m}|^6)$ when $|\vec{m}| < 0.1$ \citep{giusteriSimulationViscoelasticCosserat2021}.

A benefit of Eq.~\ref{eq:numerical schema for reconstruction of Cosserat rod} as a numerical solution schema is that it allows for flexibility in terms of when Eq.~\ref{eq:F spatial numerical eq} is evaluated. For example, in simulations we use a temporal discretisation $\Delta t$, but we can choose to only reconstruct the Cosserat rod at intervals $n \Delta t$, for some integer $n$.

\begin{comment}
We solve
\begin{subequations} 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}' & =  \mathcal{F}X \label{eq:F u} \\
\dot{\mathcal{F}} & = \mathcal{F} \label{eq:F t} Y.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
in order to reconstruct $\mathcal{F}(t,u)$ from its infinitesimal description $\xi$. Formally, they have solutions
\begin{subequations} 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_{ij}(u, \bar{t}) & = \mathcal{F}_{ik}(0, \bar{t}) \mathscr{U} \left\{ e^{ \int_0^u X(u, \bar{t}) du } \right\}_{kj} \\
\mathcal{F}_{ij}(\bar{u}, t) & = \mathcal{F}_{ik}(\bar{u}, 0) \mathscr{T} \left\{ e^{ \int_0^t Y(\bar{u}, t) dt } \right\}_{kj}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathscr{U}(\cdot)$ and $\mathscr{T}(\cdot)$ signifies the spatial and temporal time-ordered integral respectively. Numerically, these can be efficiently approximated by discretisation, and incrementally solved using the \textit{Magnus expansion}. Eq. \ref{eq:F u} and Eq. \ref{eq:F t}
can therefore be used together to trace out $\mathcal{F}$
from a single initial condition $\mathcal{F}(u_{0}, t_{0})$. Due to
the integrability of $\xi$, the value $\mathcal{F}(t, u)$ at $(t, u)$ is invariant with respect to which particular path
in $(t, u)$-space is taken. In light of this there are theoretically
an infinite number of reconstruction schemes. Below we propose what
we find to be the most convenient reconstruction scheme.

We discretise time and space as $u_{\alpha}=\alpha\Delta u,\ \alpha=0,\dots,N_{u}$, such that $u_{0}=t_{0}=0$ and $t_{\beta}=\beta\Delta t,\ \beta=0,\dots,N_{t}$
and $u_{N_{u}}=L_{0}$ and $t_{N_{t}}=T$. We define $\mathcal{F}^{\alpha,\beta}\approx\mathcal{F}(\alpha\Delta u,\beta\Delta t)$,
$X^{\alpha,\beta}\approx X(\alpha\Delta u,\beta\Delta t)$ and $Y^{\alpha,k}\approx Y(\alpha\Delta u,\beta\Delta t)$.
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:numerical schema for reconstruction of Cosserat rod}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_{ij}^{0, \beta+1} & =\mathcal{F}_{ik}^{0, \beta} \exp_{SE(3)} \left(\Delta t\ N^{0, \beta}\right)_{kj}, & \mathcal{F}^{0,0}=\mathcal{F}^{(i)}\\
\mathcal{F}_{ij}^{\alpha+1, \beta} & =\mathcal{F}_{ik}^{\alpha, \beta}\exp_{SE(3)}  \left(\Delta u\ X^{\alpha,\beta}\right)_{kj} \label{eq:F spatial numerical eq}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with the initial condition $\mathcal{F}^{0,0}=\mathcal{F}^{(i)}$.
The matrix exponential has a closed-form analytical formula given
by
\begin{equation}
\exp_{SE(3)}  (H)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & \vec{0}^{T}\\
\mathscr{B}(\hat{m}) \vec{v} & \exp_{SO(3)}(\hat{m})
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
for $H=\left\{ \vec{v};\vec{m}\right\} \in\mathfrak{se}(3)$ and
\begin{subequations} 
\begin{align}
\mathscr{B}(\hat{m}) & =\mathbbm{1}_{3}+\frac{1-\cos|\vec{m}|}{|\vec{m}|^{2}}\hat{m}+\frac{|\vec{m}|-\sin|\vec{m}|}{|\vec{m}|^{3}}\hat{m}^{2}\label{eq:A}\\
\exp_{SO(3)} (\hat{m}) & =\mathbbm{1}_{3}+\frac{\sin|\vec{m}|}{|\vec{m}|}\hat{m}+\frac{1-\cos|\vec{m}|}{|\vec{m}|^{2}}\hat{m}^{2}\label{eq:B}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\exp_{SO(3)} (\hat{m}) \in SO(3)$ is an element of the special orthogonal
group in 3 dimensions. As Eq. \ref{eq:A} and Eq. \ref{eq:B} are

\chapter{Detailed derivation of the $SE(3)$ short-time propagator} \label{app:Detailed derivation of the SE(3) short-time propagator}

Here we provide detailed derivations of the results in Sec.~\ref{sec:Geometric integrators for SE(3)-valued configuration spaces}. Let $Y = \{ \vec{a} ; \vec{m} \} \in \mathfrak{se}(3)$, $N = \{ \vec{V} ; \vec{\Omega} \}$ and $\bar{\Delta} t = \Delta t - \Delta t'$, then
\begin{equation} \label{eq:E thingie SE(3)}
\begin{aligned}
	\mathscr{E}_{SE(3)}(\Delta t, N, Y) &  = \int_0^{\Delta t} \exp_{SE(3)}(-\bar{\Delta} t N) Y \exp_{SE(3)}(\bar{\Delta} t N) d \Delta t' \\
	& = \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & \vec{0}^T \\
		\circled{1} + \vec{r}(\Delta t, \vec{m}, \vec{V}) & \circled{2}
		\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where we used Eq.~\ref{eq:SE(3) exp map}, and where
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
	\circled{1} & = \int_0^{\Delta t} \exp_{SO(3)}(-\bar{\Delta} t \hat{\Omega}) \vec{a}\  d \Delta t' \\
	\circled{2} & = \int_0^{\Delta t} \exp_{SO(3)}(-\bar{\Delta} t \hat{\Omega}) \hat{m} \exp_{SO(3)}( \bar{\Delta} t \hat{\Omega})\ d \Delta t' \\
	\vec{r}(\Delta t, N, Y) & = \int_0^{\Delta t} \bar{\Delta} t \exp_{SO(3)}(-\bar{\Delta} t \hat{\Omega}) \hat{m} \mathscr{B}(\bar{\Delta} t \hat{\Omega}) \vec{V}  d \Delta t'.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
From the results of Sec.~\ref{sec:Geometric integrators for SO(3)-valued configuration spaces} we can make the identifications
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\circled{1} & = \Delta t \mathscr{B}( - \Delta t \hat{\Omega}) \vec{a} \\
		\circled{2} & = \mathscr{E}_{SO(3)}(\Delta t, \hat{\Omega}, \hat{m}).
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathscr{B}(\hat{m})$ was defined in Eq.\ref{eq:SO(3) exp map}. It remains to evaluate $\vec{r}(\Delta t, N, Y)$. Let $\alpha = \Delta t' / \Delta t$, $\psi = \Delta t |\vec{\Omega}|$ and $\bar{\Omega} = \hat{\Omega} /|\vec{\Omega}|$ such that $(\Delta t - \Delta t') \hat{\Omega} = (1- \alpha) \psi \bar{\Omega}$. We rewrite $\vec{r}(\Delta t, N, Y)$ as
\begin{equation}
	\vec{r} (\Delta t, N, Y) = \int_0^1 \Delta t^2 (1-\alpha) \exp_{SO(3)}( - (1-\alpha) \psi \bar{\Omega}) \hat{m} \mathscr{B}((1-\alpha) \psi \bar{\Omega}) \vec{V} d \alpha.
\end{equation}
We now evaluate the integrand explicitly, we get
\begin{equation} \label{eq:SE(3) propagator calc 1}
	\Delta t^2 (1-\alpha) \exp_{SO(3)}( - (1-\alpha) \psi \bar{\Omega}) \hat{m} \mathscr{B}((1-\alpha) \psi \bar{\Omega})  = \Delta t^2 \sum_{i,j=1}^{3} P_{ij} \bar{\Omega}^{i-1} \hat{m} \bar{\Omega}^{j-1}
\end{equation}
where
\small
\begin{equation}
P = \begin{pmatrix}
\bar{\alpha} & \frac{\cos{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)} - 1}{\psi} & \bar{\alpha} - \frac{\sin{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)}}{\psi}\\\bar{\alpha} \sin{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)} & \frac{\left(\cos{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)} - 1\right) \sin{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)}}{\psi} & \frac{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi - \sin{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)}\right) \sin{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)}}{\psi}\\\bar{\alpha} \left(1 - \cos{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)}\right) & - \frac{\left(\cos{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)} - 1\right)^{2}}{\psi} & 
\bar{\alpha} ( 1 - \cos{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)}) - 
\frac{ 2\sin{\left(\bar{\alpha} \psi \right)} + \sin{\left(2 \bar{\alpha} \psi \right)} }{2 \psi} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\normalsize
where the $i$th and $j$th indices of $P_{ij}$ signify rows and columns respectively and $\bar{\alpha} = 1 - \alpha$. We can now integrate each component $p_{ij}$ individually. We define
\footnotesize
\begin{equation} \label{eq:geometric integrator R matrix}
\begin{aligned}
	& R = \psi^2 \int_0^1 d\alpha P =  \\
	& \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\psi^{2}}{2} & - \psi + \sin{\left(\psi \right)} & \frac{\psi^{2}}{2} + \cos{\left(\psi \right)} - 1\\
- \psi \cos{\left(\psi \right)} + \sin{\left(\psi \right)} & - \frac{\left(\cos{\left(\psi \right)} - 1\right)^{2}}{2} &
 - \psi \cos{\left(\psi \right)} - \frac{\psi}{2} 
 + \sin{\left(\psi \right)} + \frac{\sin{\left(2 \psi \right)}}{4}  \\
\frac{\psi^{2}}{2} - \psi \sin{\left(\psi \right)} - \cos{\left(\psi \right)} + 1 & - \frac{3 \psi}{2} + 2 \sin{\left(\psi \right)} - \frac{\sin{\left(2 \psi \right)}}{4} & \frac{\left(\psi - \sin{\left(\psi \right)}\right)^{2}}{2}
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\normalsize
such that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:r function SE(3)}
	\vec{r}(\Delta t, N, \vec{m}) = \frac{1}{|\vec{\Omega}|^2} \sum_{i,j=1}^{3} R_{ij} \bar{\Omega}^{i-1} \hat{m} \bar{\Omega}^{j-1} \vec{V}.
\end{equation}
We made use of the symbolical manipulation package \emph{SymPy} \citep{meurerSymPySymbolicComputing2017} in order to find the expressions for $P$ and $R$. We will now express the short-term propagator Eq.~\ref{eq:kinodynamic short term propagators} in terms of the sub-matrices of $X_\alpha = \{ \vec{\theta}_\alpha, \vec{\pi}_\alpha \}$, $N = \{ \vec{V} ; \vec{\Omega} \}$ $S = \{ \vec{P} ; \vec{L} \}^*$ and $Q = \{ \vec{F} ; \vec{M} \}^*$. Firstly we define
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		X_\alpha(t_0, \mathbf{u}) & := X_{0,\alpha} = \{ \vec{\theta}_{\alpha,0} ; \vec{\pi}_{\alpha,0} \} \\
		N(t_0, \mathbf{u}) & := N_0 = \{ \vec{V}_0 ; \vec{\Omega}_0 \} \\
		S(t_0, \mathbf{u}) & := S_0 = \{ \vec{P}_0 ; \vec{L}_0 \}^* \\
		F_\alpha(t_0, \mathbf{u}) & := F_{0,\alpha} = \{ \vec{f}^1_{\alpha,0} ; \vec{f}^2_{\alpha,0} \} \\
		H(t_0, \mathbf{u}) & := H_0 = \{ \vec{h}^1_0 ; \vec{h}^2_0 \}^*
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $F_\alpha$ and $H$ were defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:F H defs} using $Q^\alpha = \{ \vec{F}^\alpha ; \vec{M}^\alpha \}^*$, and
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		U^1_0 & = \exp_{SO(3)}(-\Delta t \hat{\Omega}_0) \\
		U^2_0 & = \mathscr{B}(- \Delta t \hat{\Omega}_0) \\
		\vec{s}_0(\vec{m}) & = \Delta t (U^1_0 \vec{m}) \times \left( U_0^2 \vec{V}_0 \right)
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\times$ denotes the cross product. Then we have that
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:SE(3) propagator calc 2}
\begin{align}
	\exp_{SE(3)}(-\Delta t N) X_{0,\alpha} \exp_{SE(3)}(\Delta t N) & = \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & \vec{0}^T \\
		U_0^1 \vec{\theta}_0 + \vec{s}_0(\vec{\pi}_{0,\alpha}) & \widehat{ U_0^1 \vec{\pi_{0,\alpha}} }
	\end{pmatrix} \\
	\exp_{SE(3)}(-\Delta t N) S_0^T \exp_{SE(3)}(\Delta t N) & = \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & \vec{0}^T \\
		U_0^1 \vec{P}_0 + \vec{s}_0(\vec{P}_0) & \widehat{ U_0^1 \vec{L_0} }	
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Then, using Eq.~\ref{eq:SE(3) propagator calc 2} with Eq.~\ref{eq:E thingie SE(3)} we can expand Eq.~\ref{eq:kinodynamic short term propagators} as
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
	\vec{\theta}_\alpha(t_0 + \Delta t, \mathbf{u}) & \approx U_0^1 \vec{\theta}_{0,\alpha} + \Delta t U_0^2 \vec{f}_{0,\alpha}^1 + \vec{s}_0(\vec{\pi}_{0,\alpha}) + \vec{r}(\Delta t, N_0, \vec{f}_{0,\alpha}^2) \\
	\vec{\pi}_\alpha(t_0 + \Delta t, \mathbf{u}) & \approx U_0^1 \vec{\pi}_{0,\alpha} + \mathscr{E}_{SO(3)}(\Delta t, \hat{\Omega}, \hat{f}_{0,\alpha}^2) \\
	\vec{P}(t_0 + \Delta t, \mathbf{u}) & \approx U_0^1 \vec{P}_{0\phantom{,\alpha}} + \Delta t U_0^2 \vec{h}_0^1 + \vec{s}_0(\vec{L}_0) + \vec{r}(\Delta t, N_0, \vec{h}_0^2) \\
	\vec{L}(t_0 + \Delta t, \mathbf{u}) & \approx U_0^1 \vec{L}_{0\phantom{,\alpha}} + \mathscr{E}_{SO(3)}(\Delta t, \hat{\Omega}, \hat{h}_0^2).
	\end{align}
\end{subequations} 

\section{Simplified integrator for $SE(3)$-configured systems} \label{app:Simplified integrator for SE(3)-configured systems}

The kinodynamic equations of an $SE(3)$-configured system, if expressed in terms of the sub-matrices of $X_\alpha$ and $S$, are
\begin{subequations}  \label{eq:components SE(3) kinodynamic}
\begin{align}
D_t \vec{\theta}_\alpha & = D_\alpha \vec{V} \\
\partial_t \vec{\pi}_\alpha & = D_\alpha \vec{\Omega} \\
D_t \vec{P} & = D_\alpha \vec{F}^\alpha + \vec{f}  \\
D_t \vec{L} & = D_\alpha \vec{M}^\alpha + \vec{\theta}_\alpha \times \vec{F}^\alpha + \vec{m}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $D_t = \partial_t + \hat{\Omega}$ and $D_\alpha = \partial_\alpha + \hat{\pi}$ and $\alpha = 1,\dots,d$. We can construct a simplified short-term propagator by noting that each individual equation in Eq.~\ref{eq:components SE(3) kinodynamic} can be integrated using the propagator derived in Sec.~\ref{sec:Geometric integrators for SO(3)-valued configuration spaces}. To see that we rewrite Eq.~\ref{eq:components SE(3) kinodynamic} as
\begin{subequations}  \label{eq:components SE(3) kinodynamic rewritten}
\begin{align}
\partial_t \vec{\theta}_\alpha & = G_\alpha + A \vec{\theta}_\alpha \\
\partial_t \vec{\pi}_\alpha & = H_\alpha + A \vec{\pi}_\alpha \\
\partial_t \vec{P}_{\phantom{\alpha}} & = K_{\phantom{\alpha}} + A \vec{P} \\
\partial_t \vec{L}_{\phantom{\alpha}} & = J_{\phantom{\alpha}} + A \vec{Q}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\begin{subequations} 
\begin{align}
A_{\phantom{\alpha}} & = - \hat{\Omega} \\
G_\alpha & = D_\alpha \vec{V} \\
H_\alpha & = \partial_\alpha \vec{\Omega} \\
K_{\phantom{\alpha}} & = D_\alpha \vec{F}^\alpha + \vec{f} \\
J_{\phantom{\alpha}} & = D_\alpha \vec{M}^\alpha + \vec{\theta}_\alpha \times \vec{F}^\alpha + \vec{m}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
As $A \in \mathfrak{so}(3)$, the short-term propagator for each individual equation in Eq.~\ref{eq:components SE(3) kinodynamic rewritten} can now be found using the $SO(3)$-integrator defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:Geometric integrators for SO(3)-valued configuration spaces}. The resulting integrator requires far less computation (in particular, it does not require evaluating Eq.~\ref{eq:r function SE(3)}), however this comes at the cost of omitting the broader geometric properties of $SE(3)$.


\chapter{Non-dimensionalisation of the Cosserat rod equations of motion} \label{app:Nondimensionalisation of the Cosserat rod}

Here we will derive the non-dimensionalised kinodynamic equations of motion of an underdamped Cosserat rod (given in Eq.~\ref{eq:underdamped cosserat rod}), as well as an overdamped Cosserat rod (given in Eq.~\ref{eq:Cosserat rod overdamped dynamics}, in the absence of internal frictional and body forces. We set
\begin{align*}
\vec{\theta} & =\vec{\tilde{\theta}}\\
\vec{\pi} & =L_{0}^{-1}\vec{\tilde{\pi}}\\
\vec{V} & =\frac{L_{0}}{\tau}\vec{\tilde{V}}\\
\vec{\Omega} & =\tau^{-1}\vec{\tilde{\Omega}}\\
\vec{L} & =\frac{\rho_0 L_{0}^{2}}{\tau}\vec{\tilde{L}}\\
\vec{F} & =F_{0}\vec{\tilde{F}}\\
\vec{M} & =M_{0}\vec{\tilde{M}}
\end{align*}
where $\tau$, $F_{0}$ and $M_{0}$ are time, force and moment scales
that will be specified later. We also find that $\tilde{P} = \tilde{V}$. As $\vec{L}= \mathbb{I} \vec{\Omega}$, we also
define the dimensionless moment of inerta $\tilde{\mathbb{I}}=\frac{1}{\rho L_{0}^{2}}I$.
The resulting equations of motion become
\begin{align}
D_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\tilde{\theta}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{V}}\\
\partial_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\pi} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{\Omega}}\\
\alpha^{T}D_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\tilde{P}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{F}}-\beta^{T}\vec{\tilde{V}}\\
\alpha^{R}D_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\tilde{L}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{M}}+\zeta\vec{\theta}\times\vec{\tilde{F}}-\zeta\lambda\vec{\tilde{\Omega}}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
\alpha^{T} & =\frac{\rho L_{0}^{2}/\tau^{2}}{F_{0}}\\
\beta^{T} & =\frac{(L_{0}/\tau)\gamma_{T}}{F_{0}/L_{0}}\\
\alpha^{R} & =\frac{\rho L_{0}^{3}/\tau^{2}}{M_{0}}\\
\zeta & =\frac{F_{0}}{M_{0}/L_{0}}\\
\lambda & =\frac{\gamma_{R}}{\gamma_{T}L_{0}^{2}}
\end{align*}
$\alpha^{T}$ can be seen as the ratio of the characeristic inertial
forces compared to the characteristic internal force amplitude $F_{0}$, and we have assumed that the translational and rotation friction coefficients are scalar constants. $\beta^{T}$ is the ratio of the characteristic frictional force to
the internal force. $\alpha^{R}$ is the ratio of the characteristic
inertial moment to the characteristic moment amplitude $M_{0}$. $\zeta$
compares the characteristic force amplitude to the moment. $\lambda$
compares the translation to the rotational friction.

Without loss of generality we now set $\beta^{T}=1$, which means
$\tau=\frac{\gamma_{T}L_{0}^{2}}{F_{0}}$ which is the characteristic
damping time-scale for a simple harmonic oscillator. We also set $\zeta=1$,
which ensures that if $\vec{\tilde{F}}$ and $\vec{\tilde{M}}$ are
of the same order, then $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{M}/L_{0}$ are as well.
We also then have that $\alpha^{R}=\alpha^{T}=\alpha=\frac{\rho AL_{0}^{2}/\tau^{2}}{F_{0}}$
The resulting equations are
\begin{align}
D_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\tilde{\theta}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{V}}\\
\partial_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\pi} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{\Omega}}\\
\alpha D_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\tilde{V}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{F}}-\vec{\tilde{V}}\\
\alpha D_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\tilde{L}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{M}}+\vec{\theta}\times\vec{\tilde{F}}-\lambda\vec{\tilde{\Omega}}
\end{align}
with two tunable parameters $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, as well as the
dimensionless moment of inertia $\tilde{I}$.

Let us now assume that we have constitutive laws
\begin{align*}
F_{i} & =g_{i}\theta_{i}\\
M_{i} & =\epsilon_{i}\pi_{i}
\end{align*}
then in non-dimensionalised form these become
\begin{align*}
\tilde{F}_{i} & =\tilde{g}_{i}\tilde{\theta}_{i}\\
\tilde{M}_{i} & =\tilde{\epsilon}_{i}\tilde{\pi}_{i}
\end{align*}
where $\tilde{g}_{i}=g_{i}/F_{0}$ and $\tilde{\epsilon}_{i}=\epsilon_{i}/(L_{0}M_{0})$. For overdamped systems we have $\alpha=0$, such that
\begin{align}
D_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\tilde{\theta}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{V}}\\
\partial_{\tilde{t}}\vec{\pi} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{\Omega}}\\
\vec{\tilde{V}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{F}}\nonumber \\
\lambda\vec{\tilde{\Omega}} & =D_{\tilde{u}}\vec{\tilde{M}}+\vec{\theta}\times\vec{\tilde{F}}
\end{align}



\chapter{Details of the geometric integrator benchmark simulations}

\section{Simulation of the Cosserat rod}

We simulated the Cosserat rod with overdamped and underdamped dynamics, specified in Eq.~\ref{eq:Cosserat rod overdamped dynamics} and Eq.~\ref{eq:underdamped cosserat rod} respectively. The non-dimensionalised equations of motion are given in App.~\ref{app:Nondimensionalisation of the Cosserat rod}. Henceforth all quantities will be assumed to be non-dimensional, and we will therefore omit the tilde-notation of App.~\ref{app:Nondimensionalisation of the Cosserat rod}. For overdamped dynamics we used $\lambda = 1$ and simulated for a duration of $T = 0.1$. For underdamped dynamics we used $\alpha = \lambda = 1$ and $T = 0.1$. The material coordinate took values in the unit interval $u \in [0,1]$.

To simulate the equations of motion of both systems we discretised space and time as
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align} 
		u_i  & = i \Delta u, & i=0, \dots, N_u  \\
		t_i & = i \Delta t, & i=0, \dots, N_t
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where we used $\Delta u = 1/200$ for all simulations, such that $N_u = 200$. We ran simulations using a range of time-discretisations
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cosserat dts}
	\Delta t \in \mathcal{T} = \left\{ a 10^{-b}\ :\ a \in \{1, 1.25, 2, 2.5, 5 \} \text{ and } b \in \{ 4, \dots, 6 \} \right\}
\end{equation}
and for each $\Delta t$, we ran simulations where the rod was subject to a randomly configured force and moment, and starting with random initial conditions, as well as random moment of inertia for the underdamped system. We do not consider  the effects of internal frictionional or body forces.

The angular momentum, and the forces and moments were of the form
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\vec{L} & = \mathbb{I} \vec{\Omega} \\
		\vec{F} & = \mathsf{K}^{(1)} (\vec{\theta} - \vec{\theta}_0) \\
		\vec{F} & = \mathsf{K}^{(2)} \vec{\pi}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathbb{I}, \mathsf{K}^{(1)}, \mathsf{K}^{(2)} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ were randomly generated each run using the code provided in Listing \ref{lst:random stiffness matrix}.

Initial configurations of the rod $\Phi_0 = (\mathbf{r}_0 ; E_0)$ were constructed by first generating a random closed center-line $\mathbf{r}_0(u)$ and its corresponding adapted frame, after which the latter was rotated into a deformed material frame $E_0(u)$. The random center-line was generated using a random superposition of sinusoidal functions, using the code provided in Listing ~\ref{lst:random centerline}.

For a given center-line $\mathbf{r}_0(u)$ we can construct an adapted frame by computing
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	 h & = |\partial_u \mathbf{r}| \\
	\mathbf{t} & = (\partial_u \mathbf{r}) / h \\
	\mathbf{n} & = (t_1 t_3, t_2 t_3, -t_1^2 - t_2^2)^T / \sqrt{ t_1^2 + t_3^2 +(t_1^2 + t_2^2)^2 } \\
	\mathbf{b} & = \mathbf{t} \times \mathbf{n}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
which corresponds to a configuration $\Phi^\text{F} = (\mathbf{r} ; E^\text{F})$, where $E^\text{F} = (\mathbf{e}_1^\text{F}\ \mathbf{e}_2^\text{F}\ \mathbf{e}_3^\text{F})$. The corresponding spatial reconstruction field $X^\text{F} = \{ \vec{\pi}^\text{F}; \vec{\theta}^\text{F} \}$ of the adapted frame can be computed as
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\pi_1^\text{F} & = (\partial_u \mathbf{n}) \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
		\pi_2^\text{F} & = - (\partial_u \mathbf{t}) \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
		\pi_3^\text{F} & = (\partial_u \mathbf{t}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \\
		\theta_1^\text{F} & = h\\
		\theta_2^\text{F} & = \theta_3^\text{F} = 0.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Now, given some rotation matrix $R(u)$ defied over the length of the rod, we construct the initial configuration of the rod as 
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:deformation of rod}
	\begin{align}
		\hat{\pi}_0 & = (\partial_u R) R^T + R \hat{\pi}^\text{F} R^T \\
		\vec{\theta}_0 & = R \vec{\theta}^\text{F}.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The form of these equations are such that the configuration $\Phi_0 = (\mathbf{r} ; E_0)$, which are the initial conditions used in the simulations, shares the same center-line with $\Phi^\text{F}$, where $E_0 = R E^\text{F}$. Equation \ref{eq:deformation of rod} can be found by substituting $E_0 = R E$ into Eq.~\ref{eq:eom for e_i along u}. Derivatives of the spatial reconstruction fields $X(t_i, u_i)$ and all other quantities were computed using Fourier transforms, following the numerical algorithms provided in \citep{trefethen2000spectral}.

The deformational rotation $R$ was constructed by generating random Euler angle-fields $\rho(u)$, $\phi(u)$ and $\psi(u)$ along $u \in [0, T]$, and then letting $R = R(\rho, \phi, \psi)$, where $R(\rho, \phi, \psi)$ is the mapping from Euler angles to rotation matrices. The Listing \ref{lst:random deformation R} shows the code that generates random deformations $R$.

This completes the description of the procedures used to generate the initial configurations of the Cosserat rod. See Fig.~\ref{fig:example random initial cosserat configuration} for an example of a random initial Cosserat configuration. For a given random configuration, which we will refer to via the index $\ell$, we ran simulations using the Forward-Euler (FEI), the $SE(3)$-integrator (SEI) and the simplified $SE(3)$ (SSEI) integrators for each $\Delta t \in \mathcal{T}$. Let $X^{I,\Delta t,\ell}$ be the result of a simulation using a given algorithm $I \in \{ \text{FEI}, \text{SEI}, \text{SSEI} \}$, time-step $\Delta t$ and initial configuration $\ell$. Using the algorithm described in App.~\ref{app:Reconstructing the Cosserat rod from xi} we can then reconstruct the corresponding spatio-temporal configuration $\Phi_\ell^{I,\Delta t,\ell} = (\mathbf{r}_\ell^{I, \Delta t,\ell} ; E_\ell^{I, \Delta t,\ell})$. We now define
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\text{err}_\text{close}^{I, \Delta t, \ell} & = 
			|\mathbf{r}^{I, \Delta t, \ell}(T, 1) - \mathbf{r}^{I, \Delta t, \ell}(T, 0)|
			+ \sum_i |\mathbf{e}_i^{I, \Delta t, \ell}(T, 1) - \mathbf{e}_i^{I, \Delta t, \ell}(T, 0)|   \label{eq:cosserat close error}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
which measures the failure of the Cosserat rod to close. That is, $\text{err}_\text{close}^{I, \Delta t, \ell}$ is the magnitude of the discontinuity of $\Phi_\ell^{I,\Delta t,\ell}$ at $u=1$. As the initial configuration is a closed loop, we have $\mathbf{r}^{I, \Delta t, \ell}(0, 0) = \mathbf{r}^{I, \Delta t, \ell}(0, 1)$ for all simulations. Simulation errors will however in general cause the configuration of the Cosserat rod in the numerics to no longer close. Note that it is not sufficient for $X^{I,\Delta t,\ell}(t,u)$ to be a smooth periodic function of $u$ in order for $\Phi_\ell^{I,\Delta t,\ell}$ to be smooth a smooth function of $u$.

For both the underdamped and overdampded Cosserat rod, and for each $I$ and $\Delta t$ we ran $N_\text{sim} = 50$ simulations with random initial conditions $\ell = 1,\dots, N_\text{sim}$. We then computed the sample means and variances of the error
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\langle \text{err}_\text{close}^{I, \Delta t} \rangle & = \frac{1}{N_\text{sim}} \sum_{\ell = 1}^{N_\text{sim}} \text{err}_\text{close}^{I, \Delta t, \ell} \\
		\text{Var}( \text{err}_\text{close}^{I, \Delta t}) & = \frac{1}{N_\text{sim}-1} \sum_{\ell = 1}^{N_\text{sim}} ( \text{err}_\text{close}^{I, \Delta t, \ell} - \langle \text{err}_\text{close}^{I, \Delta t} \rangle)^2.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where we have defined $|\Phi| = |\mathbf{r}| + \sum_{i=1}^3 |\mathbf{e}_i|$. Equation \ref{eq:cosserat ref error} is the supremum over the residuals between the reference configuration $\Phi_\ell^{I, \Delta t_\text{ref}}$ and the $\Phi_\ell^{I, \Delta t}$.

\section{Simulation of the Cosserat surface}

We simulated the kinematic equations of motion of a Cosserat surface, which were given in Eq.~\ref{eq:cosserat surface eom}. We discretised space and time as
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align} 
		u_i & = 1 - \cos \left( \frac{i \pi}{N} \right),\ i = 0, 1, \dots, N_u \label{eq:chebyshev nodes} \\
		v_i & = 1 - \cos \left( \frac{i \pi}{N} \right),\ i = 0, 1, \dots, N_v  \\
		t_i & = i \Delta t
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where Eq.~\ref{eq:chebyshev nodes} are known as the \textit{Chebyshev points}.\footnote{Eq.~\ref{eq:chebyshev nodes} is however in a non-standard form, as we have ordered the points in ascending order.} We differentiated functions on Chebyshev grids using \textit{spectral differentiation}, see \citep{trefethen2000spectral} for details. For all numerics we used $N_u = N_v = 20$.

To test our suite of integrators we evaluated their short-time propagators using a range of time-discretisations
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cosserat surface dts}
	\Delta t \in \mathcal{T} = \left\{ a 10^{-b}\ :\ a \in \{1, 1.25, 2, 2.5, 5 \} \text{ and } b \in \{ 4, \dots, 7 \} \right\}.
\end{equation}

Every short-term propagator was evaluated on the same initial condition $X_{0,\alpha}(u,v) = \{ \vec{\theta}_{0,\alpha}, \vec{\pi}_{0,\alpha} \},\ \alpha=u,v$, where
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		(\theta_{0,u})_2(i\Delta u, j \Delta u) & = 1 \\
		(\theta_{0,u})_1(i\Delta u, j \Delta u) & = (\theta_{0,u})_3(i\Delta u, j \Delta u) = 0 \\
		(\theta_{0,v})_3(i\Delta u, j \Delta u) & = 1 \\
		(\theta_{0,v})_1(i\Delta u, j \Delta u) & = (\theta_{0,v})_2(i\Delta u, j \Delta u) = 0 \\
		\vec{\pi}_{0,u}(i\Delta u, j \Delta u) & = \vec{\pi}_{0,v}(i\Delta u, j \Delta u) = 0
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
for all $i = 0,\dots, N_u,\ j=0,\dots,N_v$. The corresponding spatio-temporal configuration $\Phi_0 = (\mathbf{r}, E)$ is a flat sheet $\mathbf{r}(i \Delta u, j \Delta u)  = (0, i \Delta u, j \Delta v )^T$ with a constant perpendicular material frame. The system is subject to generalised velocity field $N_0 = \{ \vec{V}_0, \vec{\Omega}_0 \}$ which we generate as a random superposition of sinusoidal surfaces, which can reproduces using Listing \ref{lst:cosserat surface initial conditions}.

In our results we used $N_\text{sim} = 50$. Let $X_{\Delta t, \alpha}^{I, \ell}$ be the result of computing the short-term propagator using integrator $I$, with time-step $\Delta t$ and configuration $\ell$. For each $I$, $\Delta t$ and $\ell$, we computed the supremum of the residual integrability error $\Delta^\text{int}_{u v}$, given in Eq.~\ref{eq:spatial integrability residual} over the material base space. In other words we compute
\begin{equation}
	\text{err}_\text{int}^{I, \Delta t, \ell} = \sup_{ i = 1,\dots,N_u,\ j = 1,\dots, N_v } \left| \partial_v X_{\Delta t, u}^{I, \ell} (i \Delta u, j \Delta v) - \mathcal{D}_u X_{\Delta t, v}^{I, \ell} (i \Delta u, j \Delta v).
 \right|
\end{equation}
where the derivatives were computed on the Chebyshev grid using spectral differentiation. We also compute the mean and variance of the integrability error over the set of configurations $\ell$
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\langle \text{err}_\text{int}^{I, \Delta t} \rangle & = \frac{1}{N_\text{sim}} \sum_{\ell = 1}^{N_\text{sim}} \text{err}_\text{int}^{I, \Delta t, \ell} \\
		\text{Var}( \text{err}_\text{int}^{I, \Delta t}) & = \frac{1}{N_\text{sim}-1} \sum_{\ell = 1}^{N_\text{sim}} ( \text{err}_\text{int}^{I, \Delta t, \ell} - \langle \text{err}_\text{ref}^{I, \Delta t} \rangle)^2.

\begin{comment}
\chapter*{Notation} \label{app:glossary of notation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Notation}

%Vectors will be denoted in both as $\mathbf{v}$ and $\vec{v}$, with components $v_i$. We write the Euclidean norm of a vector as $|\mathbf{v}| = |\vec{v}|$. 


Functions $f$ are maps $f : A \to B$, where $A$ and $B$ are the domain and codomain of the function respectively. If $a \in A$ then $f(a) \in B$. We denote and define the image of a function as $f(A) = \{ f(a)\ :\ a \in B \}$. We denote that a map $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is $k$-times differentiable as $f \in C^k$. The function $f$ is continuous if $f \in C^0$, and smooth if $f \in C^\infty$. This extends to functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$.

\section*{Notation specific to Part I}



Measure, density, law




$C^0_{\mathbf{x}_0}([0,T])$




Let $P$ be the probability density of $\mathbb{P}$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and we will henceforth write this relation as $P \sim \mathbb{P}$.


$(Z_i)_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 2D)$

$\mathcal{N}(0, \mathbbm{1}_d)$

$\mathcal{N}(0, \mathcal{C})$ for infinite dimensional operators.s

$\langle X \rangle $


$\langle\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g}\rangle=\sum_{i}\int_{0}^{T}f_{i}(t)g_{i}(t)dt$

\section*{Part II notation}

Euclidean vectors are written in boldface as $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{E}^d$, where $\mathbb{E}^d$ is $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, with inner product $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}$ for $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{E}^d$. We write column vectors as $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, with components $\vec{v} = (v_1\ v_2\ \dots\ v_d)^T$.
  

Matrix derivatives are carried out using the numerator-layout convention. For a matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$ and $y(X)$ a scalar function, then
\begin{equation} \label{eq:numerator-layout convention}
	\frac{\partial y}{\partial X} = \begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{11}} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{21}} & \dots & \frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{p1}} \\
		\frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{12}} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{22}} & \dots & \frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{p2}} \\
		 \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		 \frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{1q}} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{2q}} & \dots & \frac{\partial y}{\partial X_{pq}}
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}.
For $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial y}{\partial \vec{x}} = \begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1} \\
		\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_2} \\
		\vdots \\
		\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_p}
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

Often we will abbreviate partial derivatives as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\partial_u f & := \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \\
\partial_t f & := \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f' & := \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \\
\dot{f} & := \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}
\end{aligned}.
\end{equation}
This applies to both scalar, vectorial and group-valued functions. 

If we have multiple coordinates, derivatives will be denoted by subscripts i.e. $f_u$, $f_t$ etc. or $\partial_\alpha = \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha}$.

In any dimension $d$ we will assume that $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a vector space equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. Vectors $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ will be written as column vectors $\mathbf{a} = (a_1\ a_2\ \dots\ a_d)^T$, and their inner product will often be written as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{b}
\end{equation}
interchangeably.

which for any two vectors $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in \mathbb{R}^d$ can be written in several different ways interchangeably:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{b}
\end{equation}


We will often distinguish $\mathbb{E}^d$ and $\mathbb{R}^d$. 



Introduce the vec notation here as well, and tilde notation $\tilde{v}$, and do it clearly and in detail.

$e$ is the identity of Lie groups.

introduce the hatmap and give it explicitly (and use the vec notation). 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:hat map}
\hat{v} =  \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -v_3 & v_2 \\
v_3 & 0 & - v_1 \\
- v_2 & v_1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

also have that $\vec{\cdot}$ signifes the inverse hatmap for anti-symmetric 3x3 matrices. So $\vec{\hat{v}} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$.

$\hat{v} = v \times$

$x \times y = - y \times x =  \hat{y} x$

$\mathbb{1}$ identity matrix



$X = \{ \vec{a} ; \vec{b} \}$


Matrix derivatives, and the fact that we only take them with respect to the non-zero values. $A_{ji} = \frac{\partial U}{\partial B_{ij}}$.

$\bigwedge_{\beta \neq \alpha}$

closure of sets $\bar{U}$.



\begin{equation}
	\{ \vec{a}, \vec{m} \} = \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & \vec{0}^T \\
		\vec{a} & \hat{m}
	\end{pmatrix} \in \mathfrak{se}(3)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{a}, \vec{m} \in \mathbb{R}^3$, and $\vec{0} = (0\ 0\ 0)^T$.
\begin{equation}
	\{ \vec{b}, \vec{n} \}^* = \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & \vec{b}^T \\
		\vec{0} & \hat{n}^T
	\end{pmatrix} \in \mathfrak{se}^*(3)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{b}, \vec{n} \in \mathbb{R}^3$
